Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family.\r\n\r\nA few more stopped to write messages on \"Love Notes,\" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time.\r\n\r\n\"Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,\" Abby said. \"Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year.\r\n\r\nMike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease.\r\n\r\n\"She really wanted to reach people all over the country,\" he said.\r\n\r\nGillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred \"Love Notes", "18": "Telluride", "19": "Joseph Jackson", "20": "nearly a hundred", "21": "top-level competition and fined after being found guilty of match-fixing.\r\r\n\r\r\nGary Lawson, one of New Zealand's most successful bowlers with a joint-record 10 national titles, has been suspended for six months and fined $NZ5,000 ($3,500) following an incident at a tournament last year.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt means he is likely to miss out on selection for this year's Commonwealth Games in India.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe New Zealand fours team, of which Lawson was the leader, was accused by Canada of deliberately losing a match against Thailand at the Asia Pacific Championships in Kuala Lumpur last August.\r\r\n\r\r\nNew Zealand were defeated 17-15, having already qualified for post-section play, and Canada alleged the Kiwis", "22": "Churchill's firing was unrelated to the essay, which went largely unnoticed for three years.

There are other little touches that are Jones-esque, but they add to the story rather than taking away from it. The action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe dialogue helps keep the mood light as character banter flows naturally and feels like what it is -- conversations between people who don't take themselves too seriously but have experienced life-changing events. There is humor, caring, concern and sarcasm that one would expect from longtime friends.

But the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which Nathan takes on his enemies while the background moves.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuch of Nathan's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings, like the \"Assassin's Creed\" games. That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe game's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times. Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles. Melee was improved (I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory.\r\r\n\r\r\nStealth has become a more effective tool in some missions. There was one mission, however, where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill. It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance.\r\r\n\r\r\nTargeting specific areas on enemies also didn't seem to matter. There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down. Yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy's arm to get him to collapse.\r\r\n\r\r\nNathan can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way.

Public relations people circulated versions of the story urging recipients to send it on so eventually it would reach millions of people.\r\n\r\nSlowly, thanks to the power of the Internet and the work of some intrepid historians, the hoax was exposed. The publisher pulled the book. The movie producer cried foul, presenting himself as a victim who had been duped.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time such a hoax has been perpetrated. Most of the previous stories have been spread by people who were passing as survivors. In contrast, the Rosenblats were both survivors of the Holocaust. But that fact has now been lost in the shuffle.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the danger of these sorts of hoaxes? First of all, they give ammunition to Holocaust deniers. This is a bonanza for them.\r\n\r\nDeniers expend great efforts in trying to implant doubts in young people about the veracity of the Holocaust.

The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"\r\n\r\nIt's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.\r\n\r\nThe prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)\r\n\r\nDafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman.\r\n\r\nOf course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against \"Hostel,\" \"Saw\" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.\r\n\r\nHiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.\r\n\r\nIt's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.\r\n\r\nThis director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion.

Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise,\" Obama said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. president repeated his administration's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged \"concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama's remarks, delivered from State Dining Room, were the strongest yet from the United States. \"There must be reform,\" he said, \"political, social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In the absence of these reforms,\" he said, \"grievances have built up over time.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free and more hopeful,\" he concluded.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn his remarks, Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding. And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as \"hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, \"and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption.\" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported. A CNN witness saw the building ablaze.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said the collective consequences of the government's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Within that review is military\" assistance, Gibbs said.\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The die is cast,\" said Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said, \"we've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms\" but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We don't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together,\" Gelb said, cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government.\r\r\n\r\r\nOften considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East, Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal, a strategic passageway for trade across the region.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt's government \"to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters, and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces,\" Clinton said Friday, referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"At the same time, protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"As a partner, we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately,\" Clinton said. \"They need to view civil society as their partner, not a threat.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nServers of Egypt's main internet provider were down early Friday, including servers for the Egyptian government's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarly Friday, Gibbs said that he is \"very concerned about violence in Egypt,\" tweeting that the \"government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut at least one internet service provider, Noor, was still working.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to \"defer non-essential travel to Egypt.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes,\" the agency added in a written travel alert.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times,\" the statement said, urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone.\r\r\n\r\r\nDelta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday, and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Barack Obama has requested \"multiple briefings\" on Egypt, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the target of the protesters' anger, \"but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels, including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama's messages and concerns are relayed,\" Vietor said.\r\r\n\r\r\nFormer Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak \"without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think that, if anything, one might ask why hasn't President Mubarak called President Obama and said, 'Are you with me or against me?' I mean, that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration,\" Cohen said.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances,\" he said this week.\r\r\n\r\r\nVice President Joe Biden said on \"PBS NewsHour\" on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator.\r\r\n\r\r\nStill, Biden said, \"violence isn't appropriate, and people have a right to protest.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe noted Thursday that Mubarak has been \"very helpful on a range of tough issues,\" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Wednesday, Gibbs said the U.S. administration was \"monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so, obviously, in Tunisia.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali", "161": "a vehicle", "162": "the error \"an aberration", "163": "Rohingya", "164": "10", "165": "her acting chops and sing", "166": "307", "167": "first lady Laura Bush", "168": "about 20", "169": "Michael Friel", "170": "three years ago", "171": "people are disaffected", "172": "approximately $1.5 million", "173": "Los Angeles, California, prosecutors dropped other charges", "174": "No one", "175": "A US Air big DC-9 or -10", "176": "amputated", "177": "Wigan", "178": "Ben Gurion Airport", "179": "Ahmed if he wanted to return", "180": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A man charged with stalking sports reporter Erin Andrews", "181": "Seattle", "182": "her father's home", "183": "February 13, 2009", "184": "pirates", "185": "committing \"actions amounting to war crimes", "186": "30-year rule", "187": "a Greenpeace", "188": "Mirza", "189": "genocide, even though he is not charged with the crime.\r\n\r\nOmar al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since warrant was issued.\r\n\r\nLuis Moreno-Ocampo spoke to CNN on Wednesday, two days after he appealed to the court to add genocide to the existing arrest warrant for al-Bashir.\r\n\r\nThe court issued the warrant in March on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to his five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan's Darfur region.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence shows it is genocide,\" Moreno-Ocampo said.\r\n\r\nThe warrant was the first one ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nIt includes five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging.\r\n\r\nAl-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague, the court says.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high.\r\n\r\nThe violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations.\r\n\r\nThe militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength.\r\n\r\nIn his appeal to the court Monday, Moreno-Ocampo complained that the judges' standard for adding the genocide charge to the warrant is too high.\r\n\r\nThe judges want him to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that al-Bashir committed genocide, but that level of proof is not required for a warrant, which only requires a reasonable inference of guilt, he said.\r\n\r\n\"They are requesting a level of evidence that is the level of evidence required at the trial stage, not at the beginning of the process,\" Moreno-Ocampo said.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason that prosecutors cannot provide more evidence at this stage is because al-Bashir is attacking witnesses who are willing to provide information to prosecutors, Moreno-Ocampo said. Presenting more evidence could endanger the victims, he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's a legal issue,\" he said. \"The judgment by itself is very important, but in addition I cannot accept this wrong legal standard.\"\r\n\r\nThe judges believe the crimes that Moreno-Ocampo classifies as genocide instead fall under the category of crimes against humanity, he said.\r\n\r\nEven if Moreno-Ocampo were successful in adding genocide to the warrant, he would still face a difficult task in proving the charges at trial, said Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar Association.\r\n\r\n\"Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet (than war crimes and crimes against humanity) because you have to show in proving genocide that there was an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race,\" Ellis told CNN. \"Obviously the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Moreno-Ocampo loses the appeal, Ellis said, it would not minimize the seriousness of the case.\r\n\r\n\"The charges that have been (alleged) on war crimes and crimes against humanity", "190": "18", "191": "Poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath had separated before their son's first", "192": "Clinton administration official and two former Democratic senators", "193": "80", "194": "posthumous column", "195": "biochar,\" a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste", "196": "February", "197": "achieving what", "198": "north-northwest motion and approach the southwestern tip of Baja California", "199": "Police officer Jiang Xiaojuan", "200": "shoes", "201": "the hard-pounding single \" S&M", "202": "major", "203": "$72.5 million", "204": "2001 of mail fraud", "205": "Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote.\n\nWaterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department.\n\nPresident Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales", "206": "Archaeologists began the latest excavation", "207": "Tuesday to talk about what she calls \"political interference", "208": "Jackson", "209": "John School", "210": "Herbie Hancock", "211": "$9", "212": "a copy of a letter addressed to the Ministry of Education", "213": "first", "214": "dozens of Rohingya", "215": "WASHINGTON", "216": "suspending the five-year-old cease-fire", "217": "Jason, a remotely-operated submersible the size of a small car.

Year after year, she forced me to take them at our local pool in Iowa City. Having to go against my will seemed all the more unfair to me, since my mother could not swim and was actually afraid of the water.\r\n\r\nBut my mother reasoned that if water came between her children and their safety, she would be helpless.\r\n\r\n\"I can't save you,\" she would calmly state in answer to my pleas to bow out of the lessons. \"So I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you can save yourself.\" Real Simple: Mother-daughter relationships\r\n\r\nIt's no wonder she embraced this philosophy of self-reliance. She knew how unexpectedly life can rob you of someone you care about. My parents adopted me as an infant and went on to have a biological child -- my brother, Jason -- a couple of years later.\r\n\r\nMy dad was an electrician, and he died in an accident on the job when I was three. After his death, my mother had to raise us alone, and she was acutely aware that she was truly on her own, with no backup plan. She was fiercely strong and yet constantly fearful.\r\n\r\nI have almost no memories of my father. Instead I remember Mike Fieseler. He was a former industrial-arts teacher whom my mother dated off and on for much of my childhood. Jason and I weren't his biggest fans. He was a man of strict rules, while my mom's approach could be more properly deemed overindulgent leniency. iReport.com: Share your bonding with dad memories\r\n\r\nWe resented having to share the spotlight with him -- a sentiment that was particularly strong every Christmas morning, when we had to wait for him to arrive before we could open gifts. (There is little a man can do to endear himself to children less than delaying Christmas-morning gratification.) And when they stopped dating, when I was 15, I wasn't unhappy to see him go. Real Simple: Small, helpful gestures with big impact\r\n\r\nThen, on February 18, 1991, when I was 17, my mother suddenly died of a brain aneurysm. One minute she was laughing with friends, enjoying an evening out; the next, she was unconscious on the floor. She never woke up. Just 19 hours later, she was dead, leaving my 15-year-old brother and me orphans.\r\n\r\nIn the moments of shock and horror that followed, my relatives all gathered in the hospital, and I went home with only a close friend for company (Jason followed a while later). We spent that night on our own. I was numb; it had all happened so fast. I could barely think beyond the immediate moment.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, my grandfather, aunts, and uncles were still immersed in their own mourning. Shell-shocked as I was, I knew I had to let people know what had happened. I saw my mother's address book lying where she had set it only days before and started dialing. One of the phone numbers I found was Mike's.\r\n\r\nEven though he lived about an hour away, it felt like he was there in an instant. As soon as he walked in, he took charge -- and took care of Jason and me. Among other small kindnesses, he gave me a credit card and said, \"Why don't you buy something to wear to the funeral?\" He gave me permission to be a 17-year-old -- to focus on the more mundane issue of what I was going to wear instead of weighty adult concerns. Real Simple: Father's Day gift ideas\r\n\r\nGenerally, when children are orphaned, a family member comes forward to take them in. This didn't happen in our case. Everyone had a good reason, I suppose. My mom's father was too old to assume responsibility for us; my mother's sister and her husband had three kids of their own and weren't able to take in any others; her other two siblings were both single and worked long hours. The guardian named in my mother's will was a babysitter that none of us had seen in 15 years.\r\n\r\nBut I can tell you this: Abandonment, even for very good reasons, feels awful. It was heartbreaking and terrifying to have lost the person we loved most and then to be set adrift.\r\n\r\nMonths passed and it felt like our relatives could offer no reassurances. The only news we got was that if Jason and I remained without a guardian, we would have to enter foster care. Our mother was gone, and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd, once again, there was Mike. After the funeral, he was a constant presence. He made sure that food filled the cupboards, the bills were paid, and the lawn was mowed. (Mike's adult daughter, Linda, pitched in and took care of his house.) He made sure I went back to school even when it was the last thing I wanted to do. His overbearing personality -- the trait I had hated the most -- is what comforted me the most and got me through those difficult days.\r\n\r\nMike says that Linda came up with the idea to make his role with Jason and me official -- he could become our guardian. He was on board right away. Mike still says he never considered not doing it; caring for us was simply the right thing to do. One day he made us his offer. In a moment where the grief of loss and the pain of being unwanted threatened to capture my very breath, this man, whose only tie to us was having dated my mother, said he would be honored to take us in.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, everything was different. His girlfriend, Patty, threw us a \"guardian party\" when the paperwork became official. It was just a small gathering, but it made us feel special. I received a key chain with my initials, and I remember thinking that the idea behind it was so lovely.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Mike has become not merely a legal guardian but a real father to me. When I fell into depression in college, unable to get past thoughts of my mother and all I had lost, he was there to listen.\r\n\r\nWhen my husband, Eric, and I bought our first house, Mike spent weekends installing insulation and repairing our gutters. He never wrote me off as a good, mature kid who could handle everything herself. He walked the line between trusting me and recognizing when I might need help. And what more could you want from a father than that?\r\n\r\nHis was an unconventional path to parenthood, to say the least. It is not by birth or adoption that I consider this man to be my father; it isn't even through his presence in my childhood. It is rather by sheer good luck on my part.\r\n\r\nBefore he made that generous offer, I felt as though I had lost my mooring and the waters were flooding in; afterward, I simply felt rescued. If my mother had taught me to be strong and depend on myself, Mike imparted his own lesson -- that the world will provide for you, even when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nEight years after Mike", "283": "Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges.

But suit-wearing adults who should know better are texting behind the wheel too, driven by grown-up motivations.\r\n\r\nA sign in San Francisco warns drivers late last year of a new California law prohibiting texting while driving.\r\n\r\n\"My job has me out on the road for four to five days out of the week,\" Anthony Perry, a director of business development for a Washington-based health care research firm, told CNN in an e-mail sent from his BlackBerry. \"I don't particularly think I am that good at texting while driving but I do it anyway, recognizing the risks.\"\r\n\r\nThose risks are significant. A Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study released this week showed truck drivers are 23 times more likely to be in a crash if they're texting, and several fatal accidents have been blamed on drivers or train operators who were distracted by texting.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for many in business, it seems to be a matter of competitive survival.\r\n\r\n\"Now with e-mail and with the advent of the BlackBerries and hyper-accessibility, there's this sense that if you don't show that you're always prepared and ready to respond and address an issue, then somehow you're going to be perceived as not being conscientious or not keeping up on things,\" said Tom Britt, a professor of social psychology at Clemson University in South Carolina.  Watch someone attempt to text and drive \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"I could not imagine doing my job, or living my life, without the aid of a bberry,\" Perry wrote. \"I don't know many who could who are in my line of work.\"\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs and people in service industries, such as lawyers, may feel the heat more than others, said Dr. Debra Condren, a business psychologist and executive coach with offices in New York and San Francisco, California.\r\n\r\n\"The constant pressure to be on the grid, especially in this economy -- 'Oh my gosh, has a client called? Has a potential client called? Am I going to lose the job? Am I going to miss an opportunity? -- makes us kind of revert to almost an adolescent mentality in terms of thinking that we're invulnerable [vis a vis] texting and driving,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBut those fears are overblown for most people, she said.\r\n\r\n\"There's this sense that we're so important that every single moment has to be filled; we can't even pull over or we're going to miss five minutes' driving time or 10 minutes' driving time. The pace is at this breakneck speed,\" said Condren, author of \"Ambition Is Not a Dirty Word,\" a career guide for women.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is nobody is that important or that in demand that they can't practice safety and good common-sense behaviors.\"\r\n\r\nCondren recently scolded a cabdriver who was trying to program her hotel's address into his GPS device while driving 60 mph. He got a little \"snippy\" with her but put the device down, she said, and she gave him directions to the hotel.  Watch how high the risk really is \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe subject is personal for Condren, whose son Edward was struck four years ago by an SUV whose driver was fishing around on the floor for a dropped cell phone. Edward suffered a broken pelvis and a concussion, but has fully recovered and now is a college student.\r\n\r\nIt's going to take something that drastic to get Mei Lin Walker to quit texting while driving.\r\n\r\n\"I think the thing that would happen -- this sounds horrible -- that would make me stop texting is if I actually had a wreck or I did run off onto the curb or something crazy like that,\" the Delta Air Lines flight attendant said.\r\n\r\n\"I try not to do it while I'm driving, but if I'm sitting in traffic and there are a lot of lights I will,\" said Walker, of Decatur, Georgia. \"I do think it is dangerous, and I consciously try not to do it, but then sometimes there's just a text that can't wait.\"\r\n\r\nWalker has never had an accident or even a close call while texting, she said, even though she drives a stick-shift car. Texting is easier than talking on a cell phone, she said, because she can set the device down in mid-text without disrupting the conversation if she needs both hands free for driving.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Walker probably isn't driving as well as she believes she is, Britt said.\r\n\r\n\"In general, people are overconfident and have a sense that they're capable of doing much more than they really are,\" he said. \"People, especially adults, feel like driving is such an automated skill that basically they could do multiple things in addition to it without performance suffering.\"\r\n\r\nMany drivers do understand the danger and act", "491": "Jefferson", "492": "Bayern Munich", "493": "Friday signed an executive order covering ownership of dangerous wild animals, which will strengthen enforcement of existing laws, and said he will push for tighter regulations through legislation.\r\r\n\r\r\nGov.

Nujood is angry, combative and yelling. Tension surrounds the home like a noose.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter much arguing with family members, Nujood  finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with CNN. Her presence is grudging, although CNN got advance permission to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was faring.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago. Then, there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child, a portrait of innocence. She had a shy smile, playful nature and a whimsical giggle.\r\r\n\r\r\nHer retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting.  Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World's Untold Stories \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nThe story was supposed to end with the divorce. There was, though, a stunning transformation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph. Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the fall of 2008, Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year, alongside some of the world's most impressive women. She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere is a tell-all book, which is to be published in more than 20 languages, and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's strength was celebrated by complete strangers. But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform?\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There is no change at all since going on television,\" Nujood says bitterly. \"I hoped there was someone to help us, but we didn't find anyone. It hasn't changed a thing. They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me. I wish I had never spoken to the media.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere was never going to be a fortune. Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school, but she refuses to attend, according to Shada Nasser, the human rights lawyer who took on the child's divorce case.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I know Nujood was absent from the school. I spoke with her father and her family. And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school. But they said, 'You know we don't have the money for the transportation. Don't have the money for the food,' \" says Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents say they've received nothing, and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I was happy I got divorced but I'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television,\" she said, adding that she feels like an outcast even among  family and friends.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly. And yet, as a wife, she was spared nothing.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I didn't want to sleep with him but he forced me to, he hit me, insulted me,\" she said. She described being married and living as a wife at such a young age as sheer torture.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood described how she was beaten and raped and how, after just a few weeks of marriage, she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement. But her parents told her they could not protect her, that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate.\r\r\n\r\r\nCNN tried to get comment from the girl's ex-husband and family, but they declined.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents, like many others in Yemen, struck a social bargain. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18, many times to older men, some with more than one wife.\r\r\n\r\r\nMarriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. But Nujood's parents say they did not expect the girl's new husband to demand sex from his child bride.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter several hours, a judge finally went to see her. \"And he asked me, 'what do you want' and I said 'I want a divorce' and he said 'you're married?' And I said 'yes.'\" says Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing, and the girl was put in the care of Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with her that she should get her divorce.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut based on the principles of Shariah law, her husband was compensated, not prosecuted. Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day.\r\r\n\r\r\nKhadije Al Salame is working to help the girl get her life back. Now a Yemeni diplomat, she too was a child bride 30 years ago. But when she left her husband, she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe said: \"It's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out, but the problem is it's too much pressure on her.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"She doesn't understand what's going on.

[We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community.\r\n\r\nCNN: And you did it by writing?\r\n\r\nAlexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years.\r\n\r\nCNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you?\r\n\r\nAlexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, \"Isn't that something?\" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's ahead of us?\r\n\r\nAlexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ...\r\n\r\nThe larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better.\r\n\r\nCNN: Can poetry help in that regard?\r\n\r\nAlexander: I do believe that it can.

Having served more than 6 billion songs to date, the iTunes Store has flipped the music industry on its head.\r\n\r\nIt also turned mobile software into a lucrative industry, as proven by the booming success of the iPhone's App Store, which recently surpassed 1.5 billion downloads. Apple has yet to enter the e-book market, and making books as easy to download as music and iPhone apps is the logical next step.\r\n\r\nWhat can Apple do better with e-books? For textbooks or anthologies, Apple can give iTunes users the ability to download individual chapters, priced between a few cents to a few bucks each.\r\n\r\nIt would be similar to how you can currently download individual song tracks from an album. It might even have the same earthshaking potential to transform an entire industry by refocusing it on the content people actually want instead of the bundles that publishers want them to buy. (Of course, Apple would likely offer the \u00e0-la-carte purchase model in addition to the option to purchase the entire book as one download -- a more attractive option for shorter works such as novels.)\r\n\r\nCollege students would love this: Teachers rarely assign an entire textbook, so they would save hundreds of dollars by downloading only a few chapters of each textbook. Apple is already popular in the education sector, so here's even more money to milk from students, with the textbook industry worth an estimated $9.8 billion.\r\n\r\nSci-fi fans might only want one story from an anthology, or a historical researcher might target certain subjects. All Apple has to do to secure the book publishers' enthusiastic cooperation is to offer them a generous cut of the revenues, like the 70 percent it currently offers app developers.\r\n\r\nOther than having the upper hand with digital distribution, an Apple tablet can compensate for other e-book readers' shortcomings. In a previous story, Wired.com polled students on their interest in Amazon's large-format Kindle DX reader. Several of them said they couldn't imagine ditching textbooks for a Kindle DX, foreseeing challenges with tasks such as notetaking, highlighting and switching between books while writing essays.\r\n\r\nAssuming its computing powers and interface design are anything like the iPhone's, a touchscreen tablet", "867": "greeted only with messages that the SEGA Pass service was momentarily down", "868": "Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio", "869": "very good", "870": "first", "871": "coaching for three years for his part in masterminding a fake blood injury", "872": "The Louisiana man", "873": "the quality and safety of our products", "874": "July 1986", "875": "National Park Service", "876": "Connecticut and New Hampshire", "877": "a killer schedule-- intervened", "878": "Khristine Eroshevich", "879": "Lech Kaczynski", "880": "Las Vegas", "881": "substitute Obafemi Martins sealed victory for the the 'Super Eagles'", "882": "reduce energy consumption and lessen environmental impact", "883": "Anthony Sullivan", "884": "Andre Greipel of Team Columbia", "885": "50", "886": "go because I would have no home,\" Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m.", "887": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "888": "first", "889": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Media maven Oprah Winfrey", "890": "The nine were allowed to take a friend or partner", "891": "President", "892": "stocky and bald", "893": "every step of the way", "894": "a blood vessel", "895": "Motown 25th Anniversary Special\" aired in 1983, and my parents, sisters and I first saw Michael Jackson moonwalk to \"Billie Jean.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent a lightning bolt through our living room, and all of us leaped to our feet with shouts.

Last year at the annual Human Rights Campaign national fundraiser in Washington, D.C. -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment.\r\n\r\nWhen Proposition 8 passed in California, white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent. At protest rallies that followed, some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants. Not to split hairs, but for most blacks, the n-word trumps the f-word.\r\n\r\nSo while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television, blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry. They see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets. And then there is the history.\r\n\r\nThe 40th anniversary of Stonewall dominated Gay Pride celebrations around the country, and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized, 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood-soaked years black people have been through in this country. There are stories some blacks lived through, stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told.\r\n\r\nWhile those who were at Stonewall talk about the fear of being arrested by police, 40 years ago, blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated. The 13th Amendment was signed in 1865, and it wasn't until 1948 that President Harry S Truman desegregated the military. That's more than an 80-year gap.\r\n\r\nNot to be flip, but Miley Cyrus is older than Bill Clinton's \"don't ask, don't tell.\" That doesn't mean that the safety of gay people should be trivialized or that Obama should not be held accountable for the promises he made on the campaign trail. But to call this month's first-ever White House reception for GLBT leaders \"too little too late\" is akin to a petulant child throwing a tantrum because he wants to eat his dessert before dinner. This is one of the main reasons why so many blacks bristle at the comparison of the two movements -- everybody wants to sing the blues, nobody wants to live them.\r\n\r\nThis lack of perspective is only going to alienate a black community that is still very proud of Obama and is hypersensitive about any criticism of him, especially given he's been in office barely six months.\r\n\r\nIf blacks are less accepting of gays than other racial groups -- and that is certainly debatable -- then the parade of gay people calling Obama a \"disappointment\" on television is counterproductive in gaining acceptance, to say the least. And the fact that the loudest critics are mostly white doesn't help matters either.\r\n\r\nHearing that race matters in the gay community may not be comforting to hear, but that doesn't make it any less true.", "982": "Springfield", "983": "Miley Stewart", "984": "Sania Mirza", "985": "the loss", "986": "first", "987": "Democratic Congress", "988": "John Neumar Sr.", "989": "Walter Kerr Theater", "990": "The rescue crews believe two other people may be alive under wreckage nearby", "991": "an investigation of its parent company, Petters Group Worldwide", "992": "March 2004", "993": "India", "994": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Relatives and friends of a judge and court reporter killed in a 2005 shooting at Atlanta's Fulton County Courthouse took the stand Thursday in the penalty phase of the gunman's trial.\r\n\r\nSome wept as they spoke of how the deaths have affected their lives and of their continued struggles with sadness, fear and anger.\r\n\r\nClaudia Barnes, widow of Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rowland Barnes, recalled asking permission to hold her husband's hand one last time before his body was cremated.\r\n\r\n\"He and I held hands constantly for 13 years,\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe remembered running her hands over the judge's face -- over the temple, where the bullet fired by escaped prisoner Brian Gene Nichols entered his head -- and over the judge's beard, which she always kept trimmed.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the love of my life did not suffer,\" Claudia Barnes said softly, reading from prepared notes.\r\n\r\n\"My faith in God has allowed me to remain sane. ...

Then, on a trip to Europe, Barbara became fascinated with a buxom doll that Gerber said was based on a female German cartoon character, named Lilli, who used sex to get what she wanted.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My guess is she didn't know what it was when she bought it,\" because at that point, four years after the Lilli doll's release, it had landed in European toy stores, the author explained. Handler took the doll back to the states and insisted Mattel designers get to work.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Who would have thought,\" Gerber said. Barbie was thought up by a woman and modeled on a cartoon character \"who was essentially a prostitute.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThough the men at Mattel, a company that had never sold dolls before, were skeptical at best, Handler proved to be \"a corporate genius,\" Gerber said. In the three years after Barbie's release, Mattel's worth grew to $200 million, doubling the value earned in the first 20 years of business.\r\r\n\r\r\nHandler's daughter, now Barbara Segal, 67, is a bit dumbfounded by all the hype.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's been quite an interesting ride,\" she said from her Los Angeles, California, area home. \"I can't believe this doll's created all of this.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBarbie's collector line (not what's seen on Wal-Mart shelves) is designed for the grown-ups who still relish Barbie.

Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence.\n\nThe state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors.

Military commanders urged him to fight the release of the photos, fearing it would endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe photographs first appeared in a report on \"60 Minutes 2\" in late April 2004, followed by an extensive story on the abuse by award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker.\r\n\r\n\"It was a big shock,\" said Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, the head of the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television station. \"It hurt mostly the ones who were for the fall of the Saddam [Hussein] regime. ... It was a heated debate in the Middle East at the time -- whether [the invasion] was the right decision and whether the Americans had bad intentions or not.\" iReport.com: Did Obama make the right call on photos last week?\r\n\r\nThe fallout was immediate, both overseas and at home. A year into the Iraq war, the American public had grown increasingly uneasy about the direction of the war, and the Abu Ghraib photographs gave anti-war protesters the ammunition they needed to rally around their cause and question Bush administration policies.  See Bush administration interrogation tactics \u00bb\r\n\r\nA CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll immediately after the photos were released showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans said the mistreatment of the detainees was unjustified under any circumstances. Bush's overall performance rating sank to what was then the lowest of his presidency, 46 percent. The poll also showed support for the war at its lowest since before it began, with only 44 percent saying they believed it was worthwhile.  See some of the disturbing photos (discretion advised) \u00bb\r\n\r\nIt was a blow from which the administration, especially then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, never fully recovered. Amanpour said Obama's presidential victory and big wins by Democrats in the House and Senate were proof of that.\r\n\r\n\"The American people said that they wanted their good name, the name of their country, the influence and credibility of their country's standing, to be restored in the rest of the world,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe photos did what a print report could not do. They showed front-and-center what human rights groups had been saying for months: that the Bush administration was abusing prisoners within U.S. custody. Some photos showed naked prisoners piled on top of each other like a pyramid. Another showed a smiling female U.S. soldier giving a thumbs-up next to a naked, hooded prisoner.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the furor unleashed by the pictures, 11 American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses, and some officers were reprimanded.\r\n\r\nAl-Rashed said he had expected violations in war, but nothing like \"humiliating individuals in those kinds of scenes.\" The Middle East has a \"bloody, long, bad record about torture of prisoners,\" he said, but what happened at Abu Ghraib was even more reprehensible because it undercut America's democratic values.\r\n\r\n\"You talk about democracy, you talk about the respect of individuality, the freedom. ... The prison pictures just really made us speechless.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was something completely new -- something that we had not seen before in all the dictionary of prisoners and torture and mistreatment. It just weakened the argument completely about the wisdom of getting rid of a regime like Saddam. It made the argument for the other side stronger.\"\r\n\r\nThe photographs had a direct impact within the Iraq insurgency. Just days after the photos became public, American contractor Nicholas Berg was beheaded -- with his executioners saying they were retaliating for Abu Ghraib abuses. The insurgents posted video of the killing on the Internet for all to see.\r\n\r\n\"The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals,\" Obama said. \"In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion, and to put our troops in greater danger.\"  Watch Obama explain reversing course \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe court had ordered the release in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.

To be fair, the president warned in his inaugural address, one year ago Wednesday, that all of the nation's problems would not be solved so quickly. \"They are serious, and they are many,\" he said then. \"They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nNevertheless, most Americans skipped past that section of the speech, and focused instead on Obama's promise to end the bitter partisan divide in Washington on the way to shaking up the system. That goodwill from the early days evaporated quickly, and the president's approval ratings have dipped as disappointment has grown among the very independent voters who helped elect him in 2008. That's why he very deliberately tried to recalibrate expectations at a Washington church this Sunday as he delivered remarks celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath,\" Obama said. \"Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled. Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed the seeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through the generations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been tested before.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nPoll: 51 percent approve of Obama after first year\r\r\n\r\r\nChanneling the outrage that fueled Brown's upset victory in Massachusetts, House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia said the reason for the disconnect is that the president dropped the talk of unity too quickly and instead \"forged ahead with a narrow ideological agenda that has compromised his ability to create sustainable jobs and thereby fix our nation's most pressing problems.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIn an op-ed on the new conservative Web site Daily Caller, Cantor charged his party has offered to work with the president but he has \"paid our proposals mere lip service when the cameras are on, only to rebuff our ideas in their entirety once the meeting ends. As a result, the history books may well look back on the beginning of the Obama presidency as the era of squandered opportunities.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nWhite House press secretary Robert Gibbs insists Republicans have not made serious overtures to meet the president halfway, perhaps hoping instead that Obama's struggles will help the GOP in the November midterm elections. And Gibbs says the real reason for Obama's problems stems from the fact that he made some tough decisions on unpopular -- but necessary -- government interventions to save the economy.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Ensuring that the banks didn't collapse was not a popular decision,\" Gibbs said. \"The president strongly believes it was the right one. Ensuring that two domestic auto companies didn't go out of business -- not popular. Again, the president believed it was the right decision to make.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama also frequently reminds the public that in addition to inheriting that financial crisis, he was also handed two unpopular wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a continuing threat from al Qaeda, that have tested his mettle as commander in chief. All of that has weighed on Obama's approval rating, especially the difficult decision to send more than 50,000 additional U.S. troops to escalate the war in Afghanistan. The terror incident on Christmas Day was a fresh reminder that national security is a wild card for any president.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs each day in office passes, it will become harder and harder for Obama to continue pointing the finger of blame at former President George W. Bush for all of the \"inherited\" problems. And in a strange way, Tuesday's election loss could help Obama refocus his agenda at the start of year two. A top Democratic strategist close to the White House said that it's a lot better for the White House to take its lumps now and readjust priorities in the weeks ahead to avoid much larger losses in the midterm election -- rather than coasting along now and then getting hit with an awful surprise in November.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut will Obama and his top aides dig in and refuse to move to the middle a bit? Or will they acknowledge that Massachusetts is a wake-up call, as Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and other moderate Democrats have suggested, and make some adjustments? Then-President Clinton was briefly humiliated by the 1994 midterm election debacle caused in large part by his overreaching health care effort, but he quickly picked himself up off the canvas and started focusing on bite-sized initiatives that won Republican support and positioned him for an easy re-election victory in 1996.\r\r\n\r\r\nRon Pollack, head of the liberal health group Families USA, is pushing Obama to finish off health reform quickly before Democrats lose their 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.

Neither side appears willing to back down, \"and it increasingly looks like the interests of both sides are in some ways impossible to reconcile.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt's military has been the backbone of the state since 1952, when Col.

I'm mad at myself. I'm embarrassed. I can't believe that after all these years, all the things I know how to do, I'm still talking about my weight. I look at my thinner self and think, \"How did I let this happen again?\" Oprah.com: How to prevent weight gain relapse\r\n\r\nIt happened slowly. In February 2007, at 53, I started to have some health issues. At first I was unable to sleep for days. My legs started swelling. My weight started creeping up, first 5 pounds, then 10 pounds. I was lethargic and irritable. My internal clock seemed totally out of whack. I began having rushing heart palpitations every time I worked out. Okay, I've never loved daily exercise, but this was different. I actually developed a fear of working out. I was scared that I would pass out. Or worse. I felt as if I didn't know my own body anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter many trips to various doctors, I received a diagnosis. I had hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course didn't make me lose a single pound) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism (a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain). My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must \"learn to embrace hunger\" or I would immediately gain weight. Believe me, no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the struggle I'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over. I felt completely defeated. I thought, \"I give up. I give up. Fat wins.\" All these years I'd had only myself to blame for lack of willpower. Now I had an official, documented excuse.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid diagnosis felt like some kind of prison sentence. I was so frustrated that I started eating whatever I wanted -- and that's never good.

If you have money that you can afford to part with, get out there the first full week of the New Year. Everything from electronics to clothing to appliances to furniture will be a deal.\r\n\r\nBe careful if you shop from December 26 through January 4. The bargains are mostly fake ones during those 10 days because patterns are completely disrupted by gift cards. Most people are off from work between Christmas and New Years, have the time to shop and have the gift cards burning a hole in their wallets.\r\n\r\nStores are able to \"pretend\" to offer bargains in the immediate after-Christmas period and people feel like they \"have\" to spend right away with store credit from returns and that gift card dough. As a result, the discounts are relatively small. However, follow my way and your wallet will really smile on you.\r\n\r\nWait to do returns until after the 5th and those long return lines are gone. Retailers usually give 14 or so days after Christmas to do returns so you are still OK on the deadline and you don't have to wait in lines, which I avoid like the plague.\r\n\r\nThen think about it: You get the pick of all the merchandise that people returned that has been marked down and you get access to all the stuff that didn't sell that is on final clearance. But that's not all: I love January shopping because you have the stores virtually to yourself. My favorite time to go is Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night when you will find more employees than customers in the stores.\r\n\r\nI do have a special warning about all those gift cards.\r\n\r\nA lot of retailers that have been selling gift cards this season are not going to make it.

But the deals are usually fake. Many liquidators will sell the store's merchandise at a discount, but usually not as good as prices on a regular sale.\r\n\r\nThe real money is made by the liquidator in many cases by bringing in what I call \"fake\" goods. They are not literally fake, just things that were never sold in the store in the first place.

Once fully trained, he will assist federal and local police officers as well as private corporations in nosing out deadly explosives at schools, airports and public events.\r\n\r\nHis detective skills can potentially save thousands of lives in an era where law enforcement agencies are aggressively fighting against drugs and terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\n\"Think about a scenario like the 1996 Olympic bombings,\" says Kaden's trainer Jeff Schettler, a cheery man who has coached hundreds of dogs to sniff out bombs, drugs, missing people and corpses since the mid-1990s.\r\n\r\nDemand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement. The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S. The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Watch three detection puppies in action \u00bb\r\n\r\nOfficial records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S. In more recent years, police departments realized a dog's nose was a valuable asset.\r\n\r\nDogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others. For each drop of odor detected by a dog, the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000 drops of odor, veterinarians say.  Can your pooch be a detection dog? \u00bb\r\n\r\nOther animals may have smelling skills that rival a dog's, such as pigs nosing for truffles in France or honey bees that can sniff out TNT particles, but veterinarians say dogs are the most controllable and sociable for their human handlers.\r\n\r\nPolice dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection, police officers say. Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats. They can find children who have mysteriously vanished overnight. Detection dogs can even weed out pest-infested apples and oranges accidentally left in suitcases at airports.\r\n\r\n\"They are a growing aspect of law enforcement,\" says Jim Watson, secretary at the North American Police Work Dog Association and a handler for decades.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, investigators were baffled during the international manhunt for George Zinkhan, a former University of Georgia professor accused of fatally shooting his wife and two other people.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks into the search, two cadaver dogs, a German shepherd named Circe and an Australian shepherd named Madison, arrived. Within 10 hours, the dogs picked up the scent of Zinkhan's remains in a shallow pit hidden in a thick forest. Once the dogs neared the suspect's body, they gave their handlers personalized signals. Circe barked excitedly. Madison lay down.\r\n\r\nTrainer Jeff Schettler explains Kaden is an unlikely candidate for police work. Basenjis, a breed that originated in central Africa, are usually used as hunting or show dogs. There are only two other trained police dog basenjis recorded by the North American Police Work Dog Association.\r\n\r\nMost trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs, preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record. Most law enforcement agencies rely on Belgian Malinoises and German shepherds for detection work because of their protective yet friendly personalities, but labs, bloodhounds and beagles also can be used.\r\n\r\n\"We're not trying to fix anything,\" Schettler says. \"We're trying to enhance it.\"\r\n\r\nSchettler points out some of Kaden's advantages: The dog's weight will peak at about 25 pounds", "2004": "60", "2005": "Saturday", "2006": "unseeded Kirilenko", "2007": "Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy", "2008": "since the rise of al Qaeda", "2009": "the aircraft", "2010": "congressional", "2011": "the bacterium E. coli 0157", "2012": "Klotz says anyone who's spent", "2013": "plumbing", "2014": "Tyler Perry film \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself\" alongside Oscar nominee Taraji P.

Jeffrey and Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq.\r\r\n\r\r\nPanetta said the meetings include discussions about what are the rights of American troops and what will be required in order for those troops to assist Iraqi forces in the future.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"If you're going to play a large role in dealing with another country where it requires, as I said, a large group of troops to be on the ground and to be dealing with that country, I want to make damn sure that you're protected,\" Panetta told the sailors.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. has grown increasingly frustrated with the pace of the negotiations, which have dragged well past an Iraqi self-imposed August deadline to decide whether to keep troops.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe negotiations have been strained following WikiLeaks' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged Iraqi civilians, including children, were killed in a 2006 raid by American troops rather than in an airstrike as initially reported by the U.S. military.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Pentagon dismissed the cable from U.N. investigator Philip Alston to U.S. officials, saying it had investigated the claims and found there was no merit.\r\r\n\r\r\nShortly after the WikiLeaks cable gained attention in news reports in September by McClatchy Newspapers, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered an investigation into the deaths outside of Tikrit.\r\r\n\r\r\nU.S. officials have long said they believe Iraq may need help with training, counterterrorism, air defense, command and control and intelligence operations. Any U.S. troops remaining to do those jobs might also need additional security forces.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe prospect of U.S. troops staying beyond the end of the year sits uncomfortably with many Iraqis, who have routinely questioned American motives following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\r\r\n\r\r\nRadical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose Sadrist political party is closely aligned with al-Maliki, has vowed to escalate armed resistance if the U.S. military does not leave as scheduled, a move that could destabilize the country should his militia repeat the bloody battles it waged against American and Iraqi forces during the height of violence.\r\r\n\r\r\nGen. Raymond Odierno, the new Army Chief of Staff, said last month there would be risks in leaving a large force of U.S. troops in Iraq.\r\r\n\r\r\nA large U.S. force, he said, could provoke new claims of U.S. occupation and distract from efforts to develop the Iraqi military's abilities. He would not comment directly on reports that the White House administration had decided to leave between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, should they be requested by Iraq.\r\r\n\r\r\nOdierno, who served as the top U.S. commander in Iraq, said training of Iraqi security forces was not complete.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We need to probably be there to assist them at certain levels for a while,\" he said last month in a question-and-answer session with journalists at the Pentagon.\r\r\n\r\r\nPanetta's visit to the Naples base was part of a trip that has taken him to Israel, Egypt and Belgium", "2115": "Sinaie district", "2116": "U.S. President Jimmy Carter watches UK PM", "2117": "at least 10 villages from December 14 to 17, killing and abducting hundreds of civilians -- including women and children, according to Human Rights Watch", "2118": "Pierre Balthazard", "2119": "Island", "2120": "southeastern Utah", "2121": "impartiality", "2122": "Serbian", "2123": "Urumqi", "2124": "Prophet Abraham", "2125": "Aristide", "2126": "Trafalgar Square's large statue bases", "2127": "Gadhafi loyalists in the Tripoli area and that, in nearly every case, people were arrested without warrants and far from the oversight of the Ministry of Justice.\r\r\n\r\r\nDiana Eltahawy, Amnesty's North Africa researcher, told CNN on Thursday that the arrests were more like abductions -- people taken from their homes by unidentified captors carrying out raids on suspected Gadhafi loyalists.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We spoke to several guards,\" said Eltahawy, who added she heard screams from detainees being whipped as she waited in one of the facilities. \"They didn't see a problem to beat detainees to extract information.

Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, most people, black and white, thought it would be, at best, an interesting sideshow.\r\n\r\nAfter Obama's victories in the early primaries, there came the controversial videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an Obama candidacy. But the senator moved quickly to reassure people that Wright's jaundiced view of America did not reflect his own.\r\n\r\nAmericans wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division. Obama understood that. And so did the voters. But African-Americans didn't believe it.\r\n\r\nSeventy-one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime, according to a national poll released in November by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible.\r\n\r\nObama did not just win the caucuses in Iowa  -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it. Other primary victories, once thought improbable, soon followed.\r\n\r\nThese included Georgia, and Virginia, the former seat of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nOn Election Day, Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did in 2004, though he did not get a majority of whites.\r\n\r\nUnlike other black presidential candidates before him, Obama did not run as \"the black candidate.\" He ran as a Democratic candidate, a U.S. senator from Illinois, and a progressive. And America, by larger margins than in previous recent elections, voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial.\r\n\r\nFor too long, race has been the stain on the American fabric. As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us, race has been our \"nation's birth defect.\" At times during the long primary and general election, race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue.\r\n\r\nNor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama. The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin.\r\n\r\nA lot of lessons were taught November 4. Obama's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans: White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were; a solution to our country's lingering racial problem may eventually be found; and the Rev. Martin Luther King's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach.\r\n\r\nObama's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States. \"A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country's racial problems will eventually be found,\" said CNN polling director Keating Holland.\r\n\r\n\"In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993, black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape. Even in the most recent polls taken last week, a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country's racial problems could be within reach; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end.\"\r\n\r\nYes, of course, racism still exists in America. But if a black man can become president of the United States of America, then aren't all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves?\r\n\r\nSo on this day, let us all rejoice and be glad. Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground. Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America, as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations, dies the same death it did in the November ballot box.\r\n\r\nWhat our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev. King fought and died for, we are perhaps finally ready to achieve. This is a remarkable moment. Though not the apex we need to reach, it is still a mountaintop, alive with possibilities, a dream no longer deferred.\r\n\r\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary", "2184": "talking about the man's ankle-high shoes and thick black socks", "2185": "A stone circle", "2186": "three months ago", "2187": "1000 cars, purchased between 1974 and 1978.\r\n\r\nUpon impact, the train pulling those Series 1000 cars jumped on top of the other train.

After that, I talked to Comedy Central about doing a different show, and they said sure. I brought on Michael to help me make it. We made that pilot, it didn't go, but when it was done, they said, \"We'd still like you guys to do something.\" So we started pitching around ideas, and this is the one that stuck.\r\n\r\nCNN: Does Comedy Central keep a hands-off attitude with you guys?\r\n\r\nBlack: Yes and no. They definitely trust us to a certain extent. We've had a long relationship with them, so they have a lot of faith in us. ... At the same time, they're a television network, and I don't know if you're familiar with television networks, but they definitely have opinions.\r\n\r\nCNN: They like to provide notes, I've heard.\r\n\r\nBlack: Yes, that's exactly right. So they've given us lots and lots of notes.\r\n\r\nCNN: One thing that always strikes me about you guys is that you like the comedy of discomfort, [as in] the kind of thing that makes you laugh but makes you squirm a little bit?\r\n\r\nBlack: When phrased that way, then yes, I suppose we do like that. There's something very funny to both Michael and myself about putting yourself in awkward situations and revealing this banal awkwardness that kind of happens to everybody.\r\n\r\nCNN: What makes you uncomfortable in real life?\r\n\r\nBlack: I'm very uncomfortable with sincerity. (laughs) Anybody who's being sincere about stuff gives me the icks. I just invented a term: \"gives me the icks.\"\r\n\r\nCNN: Who did you follow when you were growing up?\r\n\r\nBlack: The comedians who I always really looked up to when I was a kid were John Belushi, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy ... but for different reasons. I can't say I'm particularly like any of them, but I've always responded to comedy that doesn't point itself as being comedy. ... That's where that straight-faced thing comes from. You're telling the joke without telling people you're telling the joke. You have to trust that they're going to get it.\r\n\r\nCNN: How about Jack Benny? He was always marvelous at being able to stand off to the side.\r\n\r\nBlack: I think what was great about Jack Benny or anybody who sort of does that kind of thing -- that deadpan thing -- is you're allowing the audience to project their thoughts on to you. So you think you understand what Jack Benny's thinking ... but it's because it's what you're thinking. And what you're thinking is funny, and that's what makes you laugh.

The television network showed photographs of a phone's call log that revealed calls had been placed to Pakistan.\r\n\r\nThe boat had been hijacked, intelligence officials told CNN-IBN. Four crew members who had been on board were missing. The captain was found dead, face down with his hands bound behind his back.\r\n\r\nThe targets of the attacks included luxury hotels packed with foreign tourists.

Victims share their tales of survival and escape \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the company that owns the hotel told CNN that the company had been warned about the possibility of a terrorist attack before the massacre.\r\n\r\nThe hotel heightened security as a result, the chairman of the Tata Group and Taj Hotels, Ratan Tata, said in a taped interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN's \"GPS.\"\r\n\r\nThere were indications, though, that the hotel had relaxed security before the attack.\r\n\r\n\"It's ironic that we did have such a warning and we did have some measures,\" Tata said. \"People couldn't park their cars in the portico where you had to go through a metal detector.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I look at what we had -- which all of us complained about -- it could not have stopped what took place. They didn't come through that entrance,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"They came from somewhere in the back. They planned everything,\" he said of the attackers. \"I believe the first thing they did, they shot a sniffer dog and his handler. They went through the kitchen, they knew what they were doing.\"  Watch the destruction left at the hotel \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe security response to the attacks has brought criticism and led to the resignation of Patil, the home minister.\r\n\r\nPatil, who had been widely criticized even before terrorists struck, submitted his resignation to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a Home Ministry spokesman said.\r\n\r\nSingh accepted the resignation and immediately named Finance Minister P. Chidambaram to take over the Home Ministry post, according to a source in the prime minister's office.\r\n\r\nN. Ram, editor-in-chief of The Hindu -- a major Indian newspaper -- said Patil's departure was overdue.\r\n\r\n\"This man has been widely criticized for not being up to it and it was simply impossible that he could stay on after this,\" Ram said.\r\n\r\nThe criticism of Patil was \"that he has been very slow, that they haven't delivered in the promise to improve intelligence.\" iReport.com: Share tributes to those lost\r\n\r\nThe toll from the attacks is expected to rise as authorities count the casualties inside the Taj Mahal hotel, whose burned-out lobby was littered with shards of glass.\r\n\r\nAt least 18 foreigners were among the victims, including five Americans and eight Israelis.\r\n\r\nIndian authorities found five bodies Friday of hostages at the Chabad House, a Jewish community center.\r\n\r\nThe carnage could have been worse, investigators said.\r\n\r\n\"We found bullets with them, hand grenades, bombs,\" said R.

Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president.  See how 'SNL' has portrayed presidents \u00bb  President Gerald Ford, a gifted athlete, could never overcome the image of a bumbling, clumsy man who banged his head constantly after the hilarious portrayal of him by Chevy Chase. The senior Bush, George H.W., was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey, and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy, inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions.\r\n\r\nBut the real question being debated on cable TV because of the \"SNL\" parody is this: \"Has the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?\"\r\n\r\nI can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats will add pensively to the words: \"Not Done\" from the \"SNL\" skit, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans would add assertively : \"Not ever!\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \"Camelot II\"; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care.\r\n\r\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise. It was the promise that his $787 billion stimulus package would create 3.5 million new jobs.\r\n\r\nIf \"SNL\" had asked the question, the answer would be: Not Done! The job hasn't even been started. The United States is losing more jobs by the minute.

The raw material can be any forest, agricultural or animal waste.

There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before.\r\n\r\nBut even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal?\r\n\r\nTo shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCNN: Has being openly gay affected your career?\r\n\r\nBatt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles \u00bb\r\n\r\nCNN: When did you come out?\r\n\r\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\r\n\r\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in \"Mad Men\"?\r\n\r\nBatt: The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience, but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever. What a great role to play. This season, I'm married. I get stopped all the time on the street, and I get asked, \"When is your character coming out?\" What is he coming out to in 1962?\r\n\r\nI asked to get married this season.

I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead.\r\n\r\nThe rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition.\r\n\r\nThen there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards.\r\n\r\nThe story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging.\r\n\r\nUltimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\"\r\n\r\nSorry, Rick, I disagree.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control.\r\n\r\nRunning with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nIn one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives", "2765": "CNN.com: So what do the Democrats need to do to win the White House", "2766": "1993", "2767": "Bedtime Stories.\"\r\n\r\nThe comedian got buff for the movie \"You Don't Mess With the Zohan\" (in which he showed a lot of skin), but then he said he let himself go just a bit.\r\n\r\n\"[For 'Zohan'] I worked out like a madman,\" he told CNN. \"And then I started getting fat again.\"\r\n\r\nConcern over his physical conditioning led to an unintended consequence -- a broken bone.\r\n\r\n\"[One Saturday] I ate so much food, that I was laying in bed.

As far as the others, the accomplices, the investigation, the interrogation is under way and the details will become public very soon,\" said Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister of Maharashtra.\r\n\r\nPakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, vowed Saturday to take action against any group within its borders if it is found to be involved with the attacks.\r\n\r\nInterpol had said it would send a delegation to India to aid in the investigation. But on Sunday, the international law enforcement agency was still waiting for official permission into the country, a spokesman said.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that time is of the essence in Interpol's getting to India in order to explore any potential international links with regard to the seized evidence as well as the fingerprints and DNA of the suspected terrorists,\" a statement said.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of India's home minister could also slow down the agency's being allowed into India, the statement said.\r\n\r\nOfficials say they found telephones and a global navigational device on an abandoned boat floating off the coast of Mumbai that was used by the terrorists, CNN-IBN reported. The television network showed photographs of a phone's call log that revealed calls had been placed to Pakistan.\r\n\r\nThe boat had been hijacked, intelligence officials told CNN-IBN. Four crew members who had been on board were missing. The captain was found dead, face down with his hands bound behind his back.\r\n\r\nThe targets of the attacks included luxury hotels packed with foreign tourists. The 105-year-old Taj Mahal hotel was the site of the attackers' final stand, as gunmen held hostages and refused to leave the facility.  Victims share their tales of survival and escape \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the company that owns the hotel told CNN that the company had been warned about the possibility of a terrorist attack before the massacre.\r\n\r\nThe hotel heightened security as a result, the chairman of the Tata Group and Taj Hotels, Ratan Tata, said in a taped interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN's \"GPS.\"\r\n\r\nThere were indications, though, that the hotel had relaxed security before the attack.\r\n\r\n\"It's ironic that we did have such a warning and we did have some measures,\" Tata said. \"People couldn't park their cars in the portico where you had to go through a metal detector.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I look at what we had -- which all of us complained about -- it could not have stopped what took place. They didn't come through that entrance,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"They came from somewhere in the back.

But what Barnhart thought was a small detail -- the finale's closing song -- turned out to be otherwise for Simon.\r\n\r\nLess than three hours after the blog entry was posted, Barnhart received a voice mail from someone identifying himself as Simon, imploring him to take the post down, because there is a great deal of anticipation and betting on what the song will be.\r\n\r\nBarnhart said he had no idea the closing segment was such a big deal, saying it hadn't made a big impact on him in the past, but he realized that doesn't mean it isn't a huge deal to other fans.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is a token of the strong bond that this show has to its small niche of fans,\" he said. \"[Simon] wants to reward the devotion of those fans with a moment like that. He's decided it's important, and the fact that it's not important to me doesn't entitle me to spoil it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile some \"Wire\" fans who were duped out of an early release ranted on HBO message boards, Facebook and MySpace, Wallen said he and his friends decided to find the positive in it all.\r\n\r\n\"I guess the consolation is that we have five extra days", "2850": "Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Karen Rayner", "2851": "Monday", "2852": "one", "2853": "vitiligo", "2854": "put humans at greater risk of skin cancer and cataracts and harm marine life", "2855": "April 19", "2856": "Monday morning", "2857": "The university's student government will hold a candlelight vigil in memory of the students at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) Monday.

How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nKathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year.

The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend.\r\n\r\n\"We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,\" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. \"It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paranormal Activity\" bills itself as \"the first-ever major film release demanded by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors. But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade", "3084": "control", "3085": "lions, tigers", "3086": "December 28", "3087": "above 60 percent", "3088": "Chester Arthur Stiles", "3089": "Philippines", "3090": "McCurry", "3091": "Spain", "3092": "Louisiana Department of Social Services", "3093": "nine", "3094": "Pepe leveled the score on nine minutes", "3095": "Salman Rushdie off of its social network, and then asked him to change his posted name to Ahmed if he wanted to return.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie -- known for his outspokenness", "3096": "the numbers", "3097": "Eyup Erdem", "3098": "Blackwater", "3099": "expel the Iranians", "3100": "Wednesday", "3101": "Lionel Messi", "3102": "Latisse was discovered almost by accident, Rudderman said.

When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre, severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat, and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed. It was flying the flag of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain, Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement  -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory.\r\n\r\nAlso on board was former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney.\r\n\r\nPenhaul said an Israeli patrol boat shined its spotlight on the Dignity, and then it and another patrol boat shadowed the Dignity for about a half hour before the collision.\r\n\r\nOne patrol boat \"very severely rammed\" the Dignity, Penhaul said.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning. Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities, the captain said.\r\n\r\nBut Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area.\r\n\r\nPalmor said there was no response to the radio message, and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat, leading to the collision.  Watch Penhaul describe the boat damage \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally, Penhaul said, but Palmor called those allegations \"absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody,\" Palmor said.\r\n\r\n\"I would call it ramming. Let's just call it as it is,\" McKinney said after the boat docked in Lebanon. \"Our boat was rammed three times, twice in the front and one on the side.  Watch Cynthia McKinney discuss the collision \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in international waters about 90 miles off Gaza. Israel controls the waters off Gaza's coast and routinely blocks ships from coming into the Palestinian territory as part of an ongoing blockade that also applies to the Israel-Gaza border. Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza, which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies.\r\n\r\nTuesday's collision was so severe, Penhaul said, that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats. The Dignity began taking on water, but the crew managed to pump it out of the hull long enough for the boat to reach shore.\r\n\r\n\"It could have ended with people drowning if they hit us more square on,\" Dignity's captain, Denis Healey, said. \"It could have gone down in minutes.\"\r\n\r\nPalmor said the vessel refused assistance after the incident.\r\n\r\nThe boat was carrying boxes of relief supplies, volunteers and journalists to Gaza, the Palestinian territory that has been subject to an intense Israeli bombing campaign since Saturday.\r\n\r\nIsrael Tuesday lambasted McKinney -- the Green Party's 2008 candidate for the U.S. presidency and a former Democratic", "3230": "near Stonehenge", "3231": "Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko", "3232": "October 1991", "3233": "2002", "3234": "Almost 12,000", "3235": "highly toxic materials", "3236": "chase happiness", "3237": "global slump in property prices", "3238": "the Syrian Central Bank", "3239": "Baytown and Beaumont, Texas", "3240": "symbolize our readiness we have decided to meet not just anywhere but here in the shadow of the Oliver Tambo International airport", "3241": "fortune and glory", "3242": "Thursday that the \"vast majority\" of Palestinians", "3243": "Gotti", "3244": "The American photographed the remains of albatross chicks", "3245": "Iraq", "3246": "More than 600", "3247": "former center-left president", "3248": "Warren Kole and Michael Ealy", "3249": "Wood has reportedly been dating a 20-year-old Russian cocktail waitress, Ekaterina Ivanova, for a year.", "3250": "a lot of hydrogen vehicles", "3251": "industrialized nation", "3252": "nearly 200,000", "3253": "the era of old Hollywood?

Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel.\r\r\n\r\r\nYet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels", "3265": "Jose Mourinho", "3266": "the Liberty Sun", "3267": "Israel", "3268": "The Afghanistan speech last week and the Nobel speech", "3269": "Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Leaders of the G-20 economic summit will announce Friday that the group will become the new permanent council for international economic cooperation, senior U.S. officials told CNN Thursday.\r\n\r\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says signs of optimism for a global economic recovery can be seen.\r\n\r\nThe move comes in the wake of a major push by President Obama, the officials said. The G-20 will now essentially eclipse the G-8, which will continue to meet on major security issues but carry much less influence.\r\n\r\n\"It's a reflection of the world economy today and the players that make it up,\" said one senior official. Nations like China, Brazil and India -- which were locked out of the more elite G-8 -- will be part of the larger group.\r\n\r\nThe Group of 20 -- leaders of 20 countries representing 90 percent of the world's economic output -- are meeting in Pittsburgh for a two-day summit, focusing on the financial crisis and how to avoid a future repeat.

But a year after his inauguration, polls suggest that much of the excitement that followed him has disappeared.\r\r\n\r\r\nAre you an independent voter? Tell us why\r\r\n\r\r\nA CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released this month found that 39 percent of Democrats say they're extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this year, down 11 points from November. Forty-nine percent of Republicans questioned in the poll say they're enthusiastic, up 6 points.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"[Democrats] will try to mobilize more voters, but you have to overcome the enthusiasm gap. The best grassroots, ground operation will only work if the territory is fertile,\" Gans said.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe predicted the economy will be the most important issue in the midterms. The Obama administration has said it plans to emphasize job growth both in this week's State of the Union address and in the months to come.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"He had a year in which he could blame the Bush administration for not dealing with the economic problems. The economy is now his baby, as Afghanistan is his baby,\" Gans said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Republicans can't get too carried away. If they swing too far to the right, they run the risk of alienating independent voters like those who swung the Massachusetts election for Brown.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"If the 'birthers' and the Tea Party people win most of the primaries in the Republican Party, that may not yield as much of a Republican victory in the general election as if their more moderate elements win,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis scenario played out last year in a special election for New York's 23rd Congressional District. Local Republican leaders backed state assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava because they thought she would appeal to centrists and independents. But more conservative party members revolted and instead backed Doug Hoffman, who ran on the Conservative Party line.\r\r\n\r\r\nScozzafava dropped out days before the race and endorsed Bill Owens, the Democratic candidate and eventual winner. The split among Republicans contributed to Owens' win.\r\r\n\r\r\nA similar battle could take place in Florida, where Republican Gov. Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio are competing to be their party's nominee for the Senate race. Crist has the backing of mainstream Republicans, and Rubio is the darling of the right.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Rubio has the enthusiasm of the birthers and the Tea Party people and others like that, and that may propel him to the nomination, but it will be harder for the Republican Party to win in Florida under Rubio than it would be under a more moderate person,\" Gans said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGoing ahead, both parties need to clarify their messages and why their strategies are the best options in order to engage voters, Ossoff said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"What the Democrats have to do is get off the defensive if they want to win and start packaging themselves in a more positive light. ...

After all, dogs can't read. How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nKathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids.\r\n\r\n\"It's not just reading scores,\" she says. \"They start to speak up in class, and volunteer, and finish homework.

Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy.

Watch Zeynep Fadilioglu show off her work and inspirations \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe shores of the Bosporus Strait are studded with 16th century masterpieces such as the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by the Ottoman Empire's most famous architect, Mimar Sinan, and ornate, neo-Baroque jewels designed by the Armenian Balyan family in the 19th century. But Istanbul's most senior Muslim cleric laments that mosque design suffered a decline after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I.\r\n\r\n\"In the last 70, 80 years, we have built mosques that are copies of Ottoman architecture,\" said Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul. \"This wasn't a good development, because the copy can never be as good as the original.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu and her team of artists are hoping to change that.  Look at photos of the mosque \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe Sakirin Mosque was commissioned by a wealthy Turkish Arab family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe designers put a number of contemporary touches on the structure, giving it plate glass walls etched with gold-leaf verses from the Quran, framed by giant cast-iron grids.\r\n\r\nThe mihrab -- the alcove that points worshippers in the direction of Mecca -- is made of asymmetrical ovals, similar to a design used by Fadillioglu to decorate a restaurant in London. And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops.\r\n\r\n\"The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,\" Fadillioglu explained. \"So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the artists here never worked on a mosque before.\r\n\r\n\"It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,\" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. \"If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area. Sort of as if (they are) unwanted in the mosque,\" she said. \"That is not what Islam is about. ... Women are equal in Islam to men\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes' drive from the Sakirin Mosque stands the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, a 16th century structure built by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in honor of his favorite daughter. Unfortunately, female worshippers do not get to enjoy its stunning stained glass windows the way the men do. They have to pray in a small women's section, hidden behind a bank of chest-high shelves that store shoes.\r\n\r\nAt the Sakirin Mosque, Fadillioglu said, she gave women praying on the balcony an unobstructed view of the dome, the ornate chandelier, and the area on the floor", "3662": "the worst flooding in the region for 50 years", "3663": "second", "3664": "Philadelphia", "3665": "the organization", "3666": "The View\" were recently named on the Time 100 most influential list", "3667": "Heath Ledger's dark and disturbing portrayal of the Joker.

Watch the disturbing images \u00bb\r\n\r\nZimbabwe's government maintains that the situation is being exaggerated by the West in an effort to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to leave office.\r\n\r\nBut the World Health Organization (WHO) says the desperate situation has triggered a widening cholera outbreak that has killed 775 people and infected more than 15,000.\r\n\r\n\"You have to eat in the same place you sleep right next to the buckets, the same buckets that we used as toilets,\" one cholera patient says on the video. \"There is no water to bathe.\"\r\n\r\nAnd little to eat.

Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language", "4098": "the EPA said had high sulfur emissions", "4099": "Barcelona midfielder Alexander Hleb has turned down a move to Inter Milan in favor of returning to Bundesliga club Stuttgart", "4100": "Norio Sasaki", "4101": "the international wildlife community", "4102": "food", "4103": "three", "4104": "clubs", "4105": "middle class tax relief", "4106": "black", "4107": "go home from school", "4108": "2011", "4109": "There's a good chance this system", "4110": "the most active state sponsor of terrorism", "4111": "More than 1 million", "4112": "Ivory Coast", "4113": "Donna Brazile", "4114": "Knox and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito", "4115": "Ian Khama", "4116": "a form of torture", "4117": "Olympics", "4118": "Hunter", "4119": "the past two days of demonstrations rose to 20", "4120": "shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren.

Aides to the governor said there was nothing nefarious about the business relationship.\n\nIn October, the Chicago Tribune reported that the first lady's home-based real estate firm, River Realty, had received about $700,000 in commissions since 2000, when Blagojevich began raising funds for his gubernatorial run. Of those commissions, the paper reported, about three-quarters came from \"state contractors, family and others with political ties.\"\n\nAmong her associates, the Tribune reported, were William Cellini, a key player in the Rezko trial, and Anita Mahajan, who was charged in 2007 with bilking Illinois out of more than $2 million for drug-screening services her firm never performed. The paper reported that Mahajan's husband, Amrish, was a former Blagojevich fundraiser.\n\nDespite the reported income, the federal affidavit outlining the charges against Rod Blagojevich states the governor was bemoaning his family's \"financial stress\" and expressing hope that Obama might help alleviate it.\n\nA six-figure salary for serving on a corporate or nonprofit board would help the \"struggling\" family, he allegedly said, noting that Patricia Blagojevich's Series 7 license to sell securities makes her an apt candidate for such work", "4121": "volunteer firefighters", "4122": "39.6 feet", "4123": "boost the leadership and management skills of coaches", "4124": "an SUV swerved", "4125": "U.S. Navy SEAL commandos", "4126": "several times, tumbling 41 feet", "4127": "Press TV said.\r\n\r\nThe site was the same one where Moussavi had earlier in the day appealed to his supporters, a crowd of at least 10,000.

We could sell these cakes, they're so good.' \"\r\n\r\nLogan named her delicacy Mortgage Apple Cake and resolved to sell 100 in 10 days at $40 each to meet a mortgage payment, pay off bills and qualify for a federal program that could lower her monthly payments.\r\n\r\nShe advertised the cake to everyone she knew, including her classmates.\r\n\r\n\"The hardest part was saying, 'Can you buy my cakes, this is my problem,' because admitting to your friends that you're in foreclosure, and that you need their help, that's a hard thing to say,\" Logan said.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, a contractor promised to renovate Logan's brick-and-stucco home. But instead, Logan says he took the money and did only a portion of the work -- leaving the entire second floor bare to the beams and plastic wrap still covering much of the exterior.\r\n\r\nLogan's financial squeeze tightened when one of the actress' talent agencies shut down without paying her for commercial work.\r\n\r\nThe 55-year-old divorced mother of three fell far behind on her mortgage and other debt payments, leading her to seek help from Consumer Credit Counseling of New Jersey.

The bombs did not go off, and no one was hurt.\r\n\r\nThe SLA is best known for its 1974 kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.\r\n\r\nA parole board hearing in 2004 reduced the sentence related to the attempted bombing charge, but \"an administrative error failed to take into account\" the second-degree murder charge for the shooting death, Kernan said.\r\n\r\nDavid Nickerson, one of Olson's attorneys, said he and co-counsel Shawn Chapman Holley intend to file a petition with Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday.\r\n\r\nOlson cannot be treated as \"yo-yo\" in regard to the law, he said.\r\n\r\nChapman Holley called her return to custody \"ridiculous.\" \"It's like they make up all new rules when it comes to her,\" Chapman Holley told The Associated Press. \"It's like we are in some kind of fascist state.\"\r\n\r\nThe administrative error was verified late Saturday morning, Kernan said, after a thorough review of Olson's case.

He was hospitalized upon his return to New York, then sent home.\r\n\r\nAs a correspondent for Vanity Fair magazine, Dunne was a fixture at some of the most famous trials of our times -- Claus von Bulow, William Kennedy Smith, the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Michael Skakel and Phil Spector.\r\n\r\nHe discovered his magazine writing career in his 50s, through personal tragedy -- his daughter's murder.\r\n\r\nHe vented his anger at the legal system in \"Justice: A Father's Account of the Trial of his Daughter's Killer,\" following the murder trial of John Sweeney, the estranged boyfriend who strangled 22-year-old Dominique Dunne, in 1982. Sweeney spent fewer than three years in prison.\r\n\r\nDunne's article was published by Vanity Fair and he accepted then-editor Tina Brown's offer to write full-time for the magazine. Calling himself a \"diarist,\" Dunne dropped bold-faced names as he spilled behind-the-scenes nuggets gleaned from courtrooms and dinner parties alike.\r\n\r\n\"It is fair to say that the halls of Vanity Fair will be lonelier without him and that, indeed, we will not see his like anytime soon, if ever again,\" said editor Graydon Carter in a tribute posted on the magazine's Web site.\r\n\r\nHe bristled at one writer's oft-repeated description of him as \"Judith Krantz in pants.\" He preferred to be known as a crime victim's advocate and frequently spoke at events sponsored by victims' groups.\r\n\r\nThe fact he personally knew many of the people he wrote about set Dunne apart from other crime writers.\r\n\r\nDunne wrote that he met music producer Phil Spector for dinner three times during the Simpson murder trial. \"He knew every detail of the trial and story,\" Dunne wrote. \"He carried a gun when we saw each other, but he never pulled it on me.\" Spector later became a defendant in a trial Dunne covered.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to CNN in June, while promoting the DVD release of a documentary of his life called \"After the Party.\" At the time, he said he was feeling well, happy, and hopeful the treatments were working. \"I'm pro stem cell,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut even then, he seemed to know he was in a race against time. \"I want to have one more best seller, before I cool,\" Dunne said. \"It's wonderful to have a best seller.\"\r\n\r\nHe said his personal story puts the lie to the claim by another high society writer, the late F. Scott Fitzgerald, that there are no second acts in life.\r\n\r\n\"This is the third act,\" Dunne said. \"I have a novel coming out. I finally got it finished in the clinic ... I'm calling it 'Too Much Money.' That's a hooking title.\"\r\n\r\nDunne looked back on his life during the hour-long lunchtime phone chat.\r\n\r\nHe said he had just one regret -- his failed marriage to his wife, Lenny, who died in 1997. The couple never formally divorced.\r\n\r\n\"I loved that marriage,\" he said. \"Lenny was the love of my life. And yet I ruined it. I wasn't formed yet. The regret is that I hurt her.\"\r\n\r\nMarc Juris, truTV's executive vice president, recalled Dunne as \"a master storyteller ... who always kept his eye on the human story behind the crimes.\"\r\n\r\nBesides hosting his own show on truTV, Dunne appeared frequently on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dominick Dunne was one of the finest people I've known,\" King said. \"He was a terrific writer, a raconteur, and a familiar face on 'Larry King Live' for many years. He was a wonderful human being.\"\r\n\r\nIn court, Dunne always dressed impeccably, wearing dark jackets and gray flannels, sharply starched shirts complete with cufflinks and club-style ties. He used a fountain pen to jot notes in small bound notebooks.\r\n\r\nHe was unabashedly pro-prosecution, although he said he \"lost no sleep\" over Robert Blake's acquittal on a charge of killing his wife, and was troubled by Martha Stewart's conviction on lying to investigators about a stock deal.\r\n\r\nWhen Simpson's acquittal was announced in 1995, Dunne's jaw dropped and the courtroom cameras caught his expression. It became an iconic image. Simpson later was found liable in a wrongful death suit and ordered to pay more than $33 million to the victims' families.\r\n\r\nDunne had been battling cancer for several years -- a fight that became widely known when he collapsed in court last year while covering Simpson's Las Vegas armed robbery trial. He wasn't in court to see Simpson sentenced to prison.\r\n\r\nDunne's life story reads like one of his novels. He was born to a well-to-do family in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1925; his father was a cardiac specialist. Dunne attended preppy Williams College, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, winning the Bronze star.\r\n\r\nHe later found work in New York as a stage manager for \"The Howdy Doody Show,\" a popular kids' show when television was in its infancy.\r\n\r\nHe moved to Hollywood, rubbing elbows with the biggest names in show business during the 1960s, and became a movie producer. But he soon became addicted to alcohol and drugs, hit bottom and became his own worst nightmare -- a nobody.\r\n\r\nHe sobered up and retired to a one-room cabin in Oregon to write his first novel, then headed back to New York with just a suitcase and his typewriter.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Dunne wrote his first", "4430": "first senior goal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot after Lionel Messi set him up with a cutback.\r\r\n\r\r\nCaptain Carles Puyol had to go off with a facial injury but is expected to face Stuttgart in the first leg of the last-16 tie.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt was Guardiola's 71st victory since taking charge of the Catalan giants, and 14th-placed Racing never looked like inflicting his 11th defeat -- the 10th came against Atletico Madrid last weekend, Barca's first", "4431": "more than 100 killed", "4432": "conflict", "4433": "$22 billion", "4434": "the potential benefits and drawbacks of each type of loan", "4435": "Bear Grylls", "4436": "240", "4437": "the most serious charges", "4438": "1", "4439": "Algeria and Tunisia", "4440": "Takahashi, noting that 96 percent of high school students own a cell phone in Japan.\r\n\r\n\"The mobile phone itself is embedded in young people's everyday lives", "4441": "western Sudan", "4442": "1,500", "4443": "van Persie", "4444": "four years ago", "4445": "reporting they are getting or considering getting divorced", "4446": "the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?\"\r\n\r\nI can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats will add pensively to the words: \"Not Done\" from the \"SNL\" skit, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans would add assertively : \"Not ever!\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \"Camelot II\"; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care.\r\n\r\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise. It was the promise that his $787 billion stimulus package would create 3.5 million new jobs.\r\n\r\nIf \"SNL\" had asked the question, the answer would be: Not Done!

Could you tell us more about what challenges you had to overcome to bring Biocon to a global level? Vishala Vasandani\r\n\r\nMazumdar Shaw: My journey started 30 years ago at a time when I had to face credibility challenges that pertained to my gender, my inexperience as a business entrepreneur and my unfamiliar biotechnology-based business model. My business evolved in tandem with challenges.\r\n\r\nOnce I overcame these credibility challenges, I faced technological challenges of trying to build a Biotech business in a country that had infrastructure that was too primitive to support a high tech industry that demanded uninterrupted power supply, high quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, advanced scientific skills etc.\r\n\r\nOver the next 10 years, we systematically addressed these challenges and built a self contained enterprise that had captive power and water supply, state of the art labs and facilities and a team of highly experienced scientists and engineers capable of delivering world class research and technologies.\r\n\r\nToday, our challenges address those posed by new medical wisdom: addressing unmet medical needs, researching new drugs, new drug delivery systems and new therapies. Overcoming each of these phases has been a rich learning experience that has helped us to develop world class expertise in biotechnology. Innovation and quality have been integral to our business ethos.\r\n\r\nCan Biocon's oral insulin IN-105 replace traditional and painful needle based insulin delivery system for type1 diabetics? Can a diabetic who is taking insulin by needle based delivery system hope for change in near future?  Ajay Kumar Singh\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: Oral Insulin is not just about delivering Insulin in a tablet. It is about delivering Insulin very rapidly to the liver (hepato-delivery) which is the main organ responsible for glycemic control in our body. Injectable Insulin takes approximately 30 minutes to act. Oral Insulin takes approximately 5 minutes to act which mimics how non-diabetics respond to glucose uptake when food is consumed. This will help both Type I and Type II diabetics to manage their diabetes better.\r\n\r\nWe hope that early intervention with Oral Insulin will help to manage Diabetes especially in Type II diabetics much more effectively than is being done by oral diabetic agents like Metformin, Sulphonyl Ureas and Glitazones which stimulate the pancreas to produce Insulin.\r\n\r\nThis is unlike oral Insulin which will allow a poorly functioning pancreas to rest and hopefully help to revive Insulin secreting beta cells. Should our Oral Insulin program succeed, this will revolutionize Diabetes therapy in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you had to do the IPO again what would you do differently and when can we see Biocon listed in NASDAQ?  Harish Swaminathan\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I don't believe so. I think we got the valuation we were expecting through an Indian listing. A NASDAQ listing is only something we will address when one of our branded drugs are close to commercialization in either the U.S. or European markets. Today NASDAQ is risk averse and not valuing biotech companies any better than the BSE or NSE.\r\n\r\nI am so humbled by your story. What does it take as a woman to get to where you are today? What obstacles did you have to overcome, especially in an industry that is deemed to be a \"man's world\"? Would women setting up business in India today find it easier than you did? Irene Gonza, Uganda\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I believe that women need to believe in themselves. I set up Biocon with a spirit of challenge and a deep sense of purpose. The challenge was to break the gender bias in the business world.\r\n\r\nMy sense of purpose was to create a Biotech business in a country like India which had a very poor research culture with limited opportunities for scientists and engineers to pursue a career. It was about stopping the \"brain drain\" from India. It was about providing exciting career opportunities to young scientists and engineers. It was about encouraging young women to pursue careers.\r\n\r\nWhen one is passionate about a mission that is about change, it enables you to persevere and endure. I do believe that if I could achieve success, any woman can overcome obstacles with a sense of determination!\r\n\r\nWhen you set up Biocon did you aim to make it one of the biggest and most successful in the world? Do you need ambition like that be a success in any kind of business or does it take luck, too?  David James, London\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: When I set up Biocon, I certainly did not have such a big ambition! I basically wanted to run a successful and profitable business to start with. Ambition is evolutionary and one does not see the big picture until you reach a certain critical mass. It was only a few years ago that we developed a global ambition and built global scale in our operations.\r\n\r\nWhilst luck can be described as \"being at the right place at the right time\" or \"being prepared to address an opportunity,\" I personally believe that it is about being able to seize opportunities by leveraging existing capabilities to reach new levels. In our case, we leveraged our enzyme capabilities to pursue bio-pharmaceuticals; it was also about picking the right products (statins & Insulin) that had large markets.\r\n\r\nWe chose to partner with innovative companies and in-license innovative technologies which spearheaded our new drug development programs. We have always chosen to differentiate ourselves from the market and this has allowed us to \"think out of the box\" and stand apart.\r\n\r\nHow do you think the global economic downturn will affect Biocon and Indian companies in general?  Alicia van Waveren, The Hague\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: The economic meltdown will certainly bring tremendous pricing pressure and we expect to see our margins shrink. We also expect payment terms that involve extended credits. However, we also see a silver lining amidst this gloomy scenario as R&D and manufacturing are likely to shift to countries like India in order to bring down costs.\r\n\r\nWe have two subsidiaries that offer research and clinical services, Syngene and Clinigene that are likely to see their businesses increase. We also expect generic drugs to become a larger part of healthcare budgets in western economies.\r\n\r\nFinally, new drug development costs are under tremendous pressure both in terms of funding and development. India and companies like Biocon provide very effective co-development partnership opportunities to bring these costs down. The differences between wealth and poverty in India are starker than anywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nDo you think the poverty gap will ever be closed?  Richard Ng, Hong Kong\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: Poverty poses a huge challenge. Education and employment are the only answers.\r\n\r\nIndia is striving to address these two areas through various education and vocational training initiatives. What we also need is employment generation through a myriad of projects that span infrastructure development, co-operative agriculture to entrepreneurship. India needs to provide rural connectivity both in terms of roads and tale/IT connectivity. This will unleash inclusive growth in a huge way.\r\n\r\nToday we are caught between a political ethos that finds it convenient to keep its vote bank ignorant and unemployed and a civic India that wants to educate and harness the potential of its human capital.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Indian biotech and pharmaceutical industry is relying more on being the outsourced resource of the U.S. and EU companies rather than creating their own intellectual property.Do you think this a culture in India to not be active in creating IP or is it related to the inadequacies in the patent law?  Dipanjan Nag\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: A very correct observation. The risks associated with proprietary products are high and Indian businesses and more importantly Indian investors and banks are extremely risk averse. Hopefully, the rapid commoditization of generics and services will force companies to differentiate on the basis of IP.\r\n\r\nAt Biocon we strongly believe that our proprietary programs will help us sustain growth in the future. It is a challenge to convince our investors of this but we think they will understand this in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, what is the one piece of advice you wish you'd been given when you were starting out in business?  Karl Malone, Winchester\r\n\r\nRisk is not about taking but about managing. I took a huge risk when I started a Biotech company in 1978 and I soon realized that I had to manage the risk by addressing very serious challenges of a very primitive infrastructure at the time. It took me a lot longer than I thought to build the company but in hindsight it was still worth the effort!\r\n\r\nWhat drives you to achieve what you have and to keep going when times are tough?  Melinda Cook, Melbourne\r\n\r\nThe belief that we can deliver the world's first Oral Insulin and other life saving drugs for cancer and auto-immune diseases. I am driven by my desire to see novel drugs being developed by Biocon for global markets with a \"Made in India\" label.\r\n\r\nI am determined to see India earn a strong reputation in innovation. At a time when most Biotech companies in the western world are challenged with funding, I believe we can forge ahead and succeed.\r\n\r\nAbout Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw is founder of Biocon", "4455": "Operation Falcon", "4456": "Callebs: I think I lost weight", "4457": "Austrian", "4458": "at least 183", "4459": "three", "4460": "Mary Parish Center", "4461": "New York City", "4462": "Almost 14,000", "4463": "Laura Zuniga", "4464": "a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning", "4465": "first", "4466": "Hotels", "4467": "2001", "4468": "save energy, the actress uses the laundry line she got as a birthday present", "4469": "North Korea", "4470": "Baton Rouge", "4471": "Liberty", "4472": "House of Commons", "4473": "Marriott", "4474": "global slump", "4475": "early 1980s", "4476": "Mexico is safe and enjoyable", "4477": "helping New York City", "4478": "CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com.\r\n\r\nIf you're struggling to find work, try applying for positions that are more obscure.\r\n\r\nJob seekers in today's economy are all familiar with the difficulty in finding a job.

Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where.\r\n\r\nOfficials at Forest Lawn won't disclose where Jackson's body is being buried. If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months.\r\n\r\nThere has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch.\r\n\r\nIf a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite.\r\n\r\n\"If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,\" said Steve Goldstein, author of L.A.'s Gravesite Companion: Where the VIP's RIP. \"He'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over Marilyn.\"\r\n\r\nFame follows celebrities in life and in death.\r\n\r\n\"There's always a fascination with celebrities, but it's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses,\" says Jim Tipton, founder of findagrave.com, a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens. \"But once they are interred into the ground, anyone who wants to go can go.\"\r\n\r\nTipton's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago, when he saw mobster Al Capone's grave in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing.

They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance.

See how Chappaquiddick fit into Kennedy's legacy \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"If at any time, the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character or his ability, with or without justification, he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duty and should not continue in office,\" Kennedy said.\r\n\r\nJim Baughman, author of \"The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America since 1941,\" said he recalls Kennedy's address being \"less an explanation to the country than to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nThe nation's response was tepid.

It's natural that people express their sadness and, in some cases, anger. And there are those who are using this for political purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe investigation, he said, is \"complex and advancing.\"\r\n\r\nMexican President Felipe Calderon has promised a full investigation.\r\n\r\nOfficials have said an air-conditioning unit in a government-run warehouse in the same building as the ABC day care center caused the fire. The privately owned day care was leased by the government to provide low-cost service to parents.\r\n\r\nMany prominent Mexicans have joined the parents in saying the government is not doing enough to find out what happened and to punish the responsible parties.\r\n\r\n\"There are 46 children, and nothing is happening,\" said radio and TV commentator Eduardo J. Ruiz-Healy. \"Nobody is responsible. Federal authorities say nothing major happened. There are 46 dead children, and no one will go to jail for it.\"\r\n\r\nAna Maria Salazar, another TV and radio commentator, also has voiced her anger -- in newspaper columns, on Facebook and on her blogs. Salazar, who lives in Mexico City, grew up in Sonora state and traveled to Hermosillo last week.\r\n\r\n\"I just returned from Hermosillo, Sonora,\" she wrote Wednesday on her blog. \"Sorrow for the death of the [then] 44 children is now transforming into outrage. The death of these children has impacted Hermosillo, the state of Sonora and Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nShe's still angry, she told CNN on Monday.\r\n\r\n\"My concern is that there are 46 children who died in what appears to be negligence and that nobody's going to be punished,\" Salazar said.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she said, the government has not conducted any investigations to see if other day care centers are safe.\r\n\r\n\"What is unacceptable,\" Salazar said, \"is that nothing has been done to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Children's Fund's representative in Mexico, Susana Sottoli, said all day care centers in the nation should be investigated, the state-run Notimex news agency reported Monday.\r\n\r\nLast week, Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said officials had found safety irregularities at the ABC day care center in 2005. He declined to detail those irregularities but said authorities are investigating if anything was done about them.\r\n\r\nABC day care officials denied Monday ever being told of safety problems.\r\n\r\nCritics point to cozy business relationships between the owners of the ABC day care and government officials. News reports have said one of the co-owners is a cousin of Calderon's wife. Two state government officials whose wives also are ABC co-owners resigned last week.\r\n\r\nIn all, six officials have resigned or been fired since the blaze.\r\n\r\nThe well-regarded El Universal newspaper published a column and a story Monday taking the government to task.

The gathering is Obama's first time hosting a major international summit.\r\n\r\n\"We're meeting at a time where, for the first time since London, certainly for the first time in a year, we're seeing the first signs of optimism about prospects for global recovery,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters Thursday. \"I think the broad consensus of private economists and businesses are that we're beginning to see growth in the United States, and around the world we see exports rising and forecasts for growth are being revised upwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is encouraging,\" he said, \"but we have a ways to go.\"\r\n\r\nHe said the leaders are \"going to keep working to sustain the progress we've seen. And I can say with confidence, based on my discussions with finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world, there is a common, shared commitment to make sure we're working together to sustain these early signs of recovery and growth.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the key goals is preventing such a crisis from occurring in the future, he said.\r\n\r\n\"In the run-up to this crisis, many of the world's largest economies depended on the American consumer to buy their exports to drive growth, and we made it easy; for too long, Americans were buying too much and saving too little,\" Geithner said. \"And that's no longer an option for us or for the rest of the world. And already in the United States you can see the first signs of an important transformation here as Americans save more and as we borrow substantially less from the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we all recognize that we need to act before the memory of the crisis fades and before the impetus for reform recedes,\" he said. \"And we're trying to bring greater urgency and commitment to the need to act together.\"\r\n\r\nThe tightening of global financial regulations was expected to top the summit's agenda and comes as some major economies are beginning to recover. Germany, France and Japan have announced that they have emerged from recession, prompting hopes that the worst of the financial crisis may have passed.\r\n\r\nG-20 finance ministers and central bank governors agreed at a meeting this month not to start cutting back just yet on stimulus efforts. They fear it would put economies at risk for plunging back into recession. However, the economic outlook has improved enough that countries are being encouraged to start working on exit strategies, which will vary by nation.\r\n\r\nThe economic summit marks the third time in a year that the world's top industrial powers have gathered. They met in November in Washington and followed up with an April session in London.\r\n\r\nA number of protesters gathered in the area, tracked by police. At one point, riot police used pepper spray or tear gas on the protesters. CNN's Brian Todd was one of the people affected by the spray or gas.  See iReport photos of police and protesters \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"It really drove the protesters back,\" Todd said. \"It drove us back. It burned our eyes. It really burned our throats for a while.

He was subdued by passengers and crew.\r\r\n\r\r\nNo air marshals were on the flight, generating additional criticism of the service.\r\r\n\r\r\nDespite efforts by Obama and assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that FAMS will become more effective, one air marshal told CNN, \"Nothing's particularly changed for me since Christmas Day, or (for) a big percentage of people that I work with.

The prosecution has also alleged the Ellis went \"ballistic in a profane tirade\" that continued when police officers arrived.\r\n\r\nEllis, now a schoolteacher, denied all accusations against her, although she acknowledged in her Friday testimony that she touched another shopper's items on the conveyor belt.\r\n\r\nShe was initially charged with assaulting police officers, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace. Had she been convicted of those charges, she could have been sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.\r\n\r\nEllis, then a college student with no criminal history, has said that some white patrons shoved and hurled racial slurs at her when she switched checkout lines. Store employees refused to give her her change and called police, she said.\r\n\r\nShe said Friday that the incident began when she joined her cousin in the checkout line and was ignored by the clerk. She did not not cut in line and did not yell or use profanity, said Ellis, who has not spoken about the case outside of court.\r\n\r\nAs she left the store, Ellis told the Dunklin County Circuit Court, a police officer told her, \"Look at this stupid bitch. Take your ass back to the ghetto.\"\r\n\r\nShe alleged that an officer behind her forcefully grabbed her shoulder without telling her she was being arrested.\r\n\r\nShe did not resist, but said her body was \"flung around\" by officers. She screamed loudly for help as officers \"choked\" her and pulled her hair, but she did not hit or kick them, she testified.\r\n\r\nTestimony from Ellis' cousin, who was with her at the Wal-Mart, and from her aunt, whom the cousin called as Ellis was arrested, backed up the young woman's account.\r\n\r\nEllis said she saw a doctor after the incident because tight handcuffs had cut her and made her bleed. She said she also had a headache and neck pain from the incident.\r\n\r\nAn emergency room doctor testified that he had seen bruises on one of Ellis' wrists, but did not see cuts or bleeding. He also said he did not see any neck or head injuries.\r\n\r\nSurveillance tapes from the store were shown in court Thursday and released publicly, but the tapes don't show much of the alleged confrontation.\r\n\r\nA camera from above the cash register appeared to show Ellis' arm shoving merchandise to the side on the register's conveyor belt. Another camera showed her being led out of the store by police, with her arm in the air. A third, from the parking lot, showed her being handcuffed and put into a police car. It appeared to show Ellis kicking backward at police, as authorities allege. Her defense maintains she did so after police had assaulted her.\r\n\r\nOfficials with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference have said the case is indicative of racial bias in the town, where 13 percent of the population is African-American.\r\n\r\nBlack and Hispanic residents have long complained of being unfairly profiled during traffic stops by the predominantly white police department.\r\n\r\nWhen Ellis' supporters held a peaceful rally in June, officers found business cards scattered along the route that read: \"You have been paid a social visit by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

They've built a small, not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis prestige over practicality issue something of a recurring theme in Dubai's banner building projects.\r\n\r\nKrane, who lived and worked in Dubai from 2005 to 2007, also called into questions the attraction of the Palm Islands. The $12 billion Palm Jumeirah -- populated with valuable villas and hotels -- could have been a lot better he says.\r\n\r\n\"It's not been very well done. You can't even see the sea and all the fronds which house the communities are gated.\"\r\n\r\nIts sister islands the Palm Deira -- which developers say will be the size of Manhattan Island housing 1.5 million residents -- has yet to be completed.\r\n\r\nKrane hopes it never is. \"It's on the Sharjah border [one of the six other emirates] and is the most densely populated part of the city. There's no infrastructure at all over there for and extra 1.5 million residents\"\r\n\r\nAnd despite the best efforts of the property companies the Palm Islands have still harmed the area's marine environment.\r\n\r\nThe environmental damage isn't limited to the coastline according to Krane. The huge boulders helping lay the foundations for coastal reclamation projects like Waterfront project -- which developers boast will be twice the size of Hong Kong Island -- are, he says, slowly laying waste to some of the UAE's more picturesque mountain regions.\r\n\r\nBut with the renewed financial uncertainty Dubai's ambitions are likely to be reigned in.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, it was announced that the new Palazzo Versace hotel", "4738": "David Vitter", "4739": "going to be, you know", "4740": "they plan to return and rebuild", "4741": "a solar torch and painted", "4742": "July 2007", "4743": "Wednesday, 63 percent said they approve of how Obama is handling his duties.

Bush eight years ago, and it may be one reason why Obama's approval rating is still in the 60s.\"\r\n\r\nHow does Obama compare with his predecessors around the first 100-days mark?\r\n\r\nBush stood at 62 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll in April 2001; Bill Clinton at 55 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll in April 1993; George H.W. Bush at 58 percent in a Gallup Poll from April 1989; and Ronald Reagan at 67 percent in a Gallup Poll in April 1981.\r\n\r\n\"The 100-day mark tends to fall during a period when Americans are still evaluating a new president. The danger period for most presidents comes later in their first year in office,\" Holland said.\r\n\r\n\"Bill Clinton, for example, still had good marks after his first 100 days, but his approval rating had tanked by June of 1993. Ronald Reagan's approval rating stayed over 50 percent until November of his first year in office, but once it slipped below that mark, it stayed under 50 percent for two years.

But few dispute that the uprising launched on January 25 has changed an ancient nation in a fundamental way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I am optimistic about the future. We can't go back,\" said Lillian Wagdy, a photographer who was taking part in the protests. \"The wall of fear has fallen, and the people will now demand their rights and stay on the streets.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics, said Egyptians have undergone a \"psychological rapture\" since the revolution.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The psychology of the citizen has changed,\" he said. \"Millions of voiceless people have regained their voices ... It's changed the relationship between sons and fathers and fathers and daughters.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests lasted 18 days, growing despite clashes with police and pro-Mubarak gangs. The armed forces refused to intercede on Mubarak's behalf, and he handed over power to a council of generals on February 11.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe generals suspended Egypt's constitution and named a civilian caretaker government, but remain the final authority in Cairo. That's one of the things that rankles the protesters who have made camp in Tahrir Square since a fresh round of protests in June.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"For me to leave Tahrir, the ruling generals need to listen to our demands and take action to ensure them,\" said Mustafa Sadek, a 16-year-old high-school student taking part in the protests last week. \"We also want a clear schedule, a path to elections and reform. We want a plan that lays out the future.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nRajia Omran, a lawyer and human rights activist, said the revolution \"isn't going too bad.\" But she said patience will be needed for months or even years to come.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It will take 5 to 10 years to evaluate the revolution,\" said Omran, whose group helped organize the first protests. \"Nobody can evaluate it now. Any evaluation now is premature.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nWith liberals, nationalists, leftists and Islamists now split over whether elections or constitutional reforms should come first, Gerges said the protesters are realizing an old lesson: \"Revolutions are messy.\" But those debates are \"a healthy sign that civil society is still alive.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My worry is the cleavages are much deeper than we think, and the question is, will there be a government that will be able to govern in the next two or three years?\" Gerges said. \"If you don't have a consensus on what the future is, you won't be able to govern.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nJumana Shehata, a former media consultant at the National Council for Human Rights, has been critical of the path the revolution has taken. She said secular political parties need more time to organize as a counterweight to the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Right now, the Muslim Brotherhood is the only strong party, and we need more diversity,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Gerges said the Brotherhood has its own divisions, with younger members \"closer to the nationalists and the liberals and the leftists than the old guard.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe military's decision recent decision to delay parliamentary elections until November is a concession to the secular groups, said Shadi Hamid, an analyst at the Qatar-based branch of the Brookings Institution. Hamid said that vote \"will clarify matters,\" demonstrating which of the competing factions \"have the support and capability to push things forward and challenge the military's hold on power.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nShehata took part in the January protests at Tahrir Square and said most Egyptians still support the revolution, but are \"fed up\" with the new demonstrations.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I understand the chaos after a revolution, but I don't see the people in Tahrir now as revolutionaries,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Hamid called the renewed protests a \"frightening turn\" in post-revolutionary Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"More and more, the military staff is being portrayed as an enemy of democracy and an enemy of the transition, at least among the people in Tahrir Square,\" Hamid said. Neither side appears willing to back down, \"and it increasingly looks like the interests of both sides are in some ways impossible to reconcile.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt's military has been the backbone of the state since 1952, when Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser led a coup that toppled the country's monarchy -- and the generals will likely try to keep much of that influence in any new government, said Nathan Brown, a Middle East analyst at George Washington University.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There's no question the military does not want to be responsible for collecting the trash and running the schools and the health-care system and the economy, which is a mess,\" Brown told CNN. \"They don't want civilian oversight when they do go back to the barracks, and they don't want to lose a privileged position in Egyptian political and social life.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut that sort of privilege may be harder to come by in the new Egypt. During the March referendum on changes to the country's constitution, Brown said, newspapers carried stories about VIPs who showed up at polling places where long lines had formed, expecting to be allowed to vote ahead of the hoi polloi.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Every time this happened, they were told, 'Wait a minute, this is a different country now. You've got to wait in line,'\" he said. \"It's a less deferential, less hierarchical place than it used to be.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHamid said the most realistic outcome is that the military will keep \"some control\" over international affairs and defense policy in a new government, as well as its extensive economic interests. But he said the generals appear to be boxing in the debate over their own authority in advance.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt the same time, Egyptians are awaiting a reckoning with Mubarak and some of the leading figures in his former regime. Mubarak and his ex-interior minster, Habib al-Adly, are accused of ordering police to use live ammunition on protesters -- a charge that could carry a death sentence upon conviction. Several other figures, including Mubarak's two sons, face public corruption charges. And Wagdy said some of the generals need to be in the dock as well.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The main generals were part of the Mubarak regime and part of the corruption,\" she said. \"We need to dig into their files and prosecute them.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGerges", "5059": "fifth", "5060": "There has been a significant increase", "5061": "Kate Gosselin", "5062": "Alan Garcia", "5063": "India", "5064": "the craft of journalism", "5065": "Hashim Amla", "5066": "decreases the function of the immune system", "5067": "over how they will get their next meals", "5068": "Harlem's Apollo Theater", "5069": "August 25, 2002", "5070": "displaying magazine pages", "5071": "Ed McMahon", "5072": "Kashmir", "5073": "Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- With a wink of its eye, Canada brought to close the Winter Olympics by making fun of one the glitches that plagued the first week of the games.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs the closing ceremonies began, a mime with a tool belt came out to the caldron, where one", "5074": "Patrick Dempsey", "5075": "more than $100,000 a year", "5076": "Human rights groups decry the actions as politically motivated", "5077": "death last year of Eve Carson", "5078": "matter of competitive survival", "5079": "Some officials claim it has now eclipsed illegal drugs as a criminal moneymaker.\r\n\r\n\"It's very seldom reported ... if discovered by companies, they generally don't want the public to know they've been had,\" said Eugene Spafford, a computer security specialist at Purdue University who has advised two U.S. presidents and numerous companies and government agencies.\r\n\r\nCyber crime is one of the few industries benefiting from the financial crisis. Last year, antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined. In the United States, the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year.\r\n\r\nCompanies lost an average of $4.6 million in intellectual property last year, according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by Purdue University and McAfee.\r\n\r\n\"As the economy has declined, we've seen the threat landscape increase,\" David DeWalt, president and CEO of McAfee, recently told Richard Quest for CNN International's \"Quest Means Business.\"\r\n\r\nThat increase has helped antivirus makers such as McAfee snare record returns -- the company's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year.\r\n\r\nBut companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with Web-savvy criminals, experts say.\r\n\r\n\"The fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains,\" said Michael Fraser, director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.\r\n\r\n\"They have R&D departments, strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal,\" Fraser said.\r\n\r\nOn these Web sites, would-be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own \"botnet\" -- referring to software that can, unbeknownst to victims, turn their computers into spamming foot-soldiers for criminal networks. One Web site advertises software that can capture information for a popular Internet secured-payment provider for $500 -- discounted to $400 for the first 100 buyers.\r\n\r\nSkimmed credit card numbers and other personal-identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on Web sites, Fraser said. \"When police shut these Web sites down, they just mushroom up some other place,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAlthough the techniques of cyber crime have evolved, online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages. In the digital age, that means tempting with free downloads, money schemes and pornography.\r\n\r\nThe range of tools used by cyber criminals reveals the quick evolution of the industry. Viruses -- the first generation of the computer culprits -- are used for the computer equivalent of vandalism, as the malicious programs replicate, spread and damage computers.\r\n\r\n\"When the company was set up, we were seeing two or three new viruses a week,\" said Mahendra Negi, chief financial officer of Tokyo-based antivirus maker Trend Micro. \"Now there's a new one every two-and-a-half seconds.\r\n\r\n\"With the arrival of spam in 2001 and 2002, the big difference was it was commercial malware,\" Negi said. \"Once money became involved, the level of sophistication raised a hundred-fold.\"\r\n\r\nNow the biggest threats include \"phishing\" schemes and \"botnet\" attacks.\r\n\r\nPhishing is where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or Web site and trick victims into revealing passwords, credit card information and other personal data.\r\n\r\nBotnet attackers commandeer personal computers as part of a large network of \"zombie\" computers that, on command, target companies for spam attacks to cripple IT capabilities. Botnets -- some of which are large enough to deploy tens of billions of spam e-mails a day -- are often used in extortion schemes.\r\n\r\n\"They ring up the IT manager of a company and say, 'Pay us a million or we'll take you down',\" said Fraser, who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks.\r\n\r\nCompanies often pay up and shut up, computer experts say, rather than report the crime and garner publicity that may hurt their corporate reputation.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike prankster virus-makers, these malware makers are determined to stay hidden.\r\n\r\n\"Once it became a business, then (cyber criminals) began to look at what companies like us were doing, and figure out weaknesses,\" he said. \"They are very customer friendly ... they sell updates, they will highlight what the product does and what antivirus software can't detect them.\r\n\r\nAdding to the difficulty is the legal situation that in many jurisdictions, it is not illegal to create or sell malware.\r\n\r\n\"It's like the arms industry ... it's not a crime to build and sell them,\" Negi said.\r\n\r\nAnd because of the transnational nature of the crime, it's extremely difficult to prosecute. A scan of 500 headlines on Internet-related arrests from newspapers around the world the past two years found about 90 percent were related to child-pornography cases.\r\n\r\n\"Child pornography is easier to prosecute because it is possible to find the evidence on the perpetrator's computer systems,\" said Spafford of Purdue University.\r\n\r\nCyber-criminal networks are as porous as the Internet itself.\r\n\r\n\"There are multiple jurisdictions and unless it's an ongoing crime that uses the same path all the time, the trail goes cold quickly,\" Spafford said. \"I may be able to trace back to a computer system, if I'm lucky, or trace it back to a cyber cafe -- but how do I know who was behind it?\"\r\n\r\nOften criminal networks are run in countries such as Russia and China, where government officials turn a blind eye to these activities -- so long as their victims reside outside the host country, Spafford said.\r\n\r\n\"For the host countries, that's dangerous ... it's kind of like breeding tigers in the back yard and saying, 'Well, they haven't hurt anyone here yet,'\" he said. \"Mexico is a wonderful example ... they tolerated drug smugglers for years, and now it's such a major problem and incredibly painful and costly to run them out.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not saying (cyber criminals) are involved in physical violence, but it's not out of the realm of possibility,\" he said. \"What are they doing with all that money", "5080": "abuse toward Christians in Iraq", "5081": "Renee Zellweger", "5082": "Adam Sandler had to cope with more than just falling gumballs in his latest comedy, \"Bedtime Stories.\"\r\n\r\nThe comedian got buff for the movie \"You Don't Mess With the Zohan\" (in which he showed a lot of skin), but then he said he let himself go just a bit.\r\n\r\n\"[For 'Zohan'] I worked out like a madman,\" he told CNN. \"And then I started getting fat again.\"\r\n\r\nConcern over his physical conditioning led to an unintended consequence -- a broken bone.\r\n\r\n\"[One Saturday] I ate so much food, that I was laying in bed.
