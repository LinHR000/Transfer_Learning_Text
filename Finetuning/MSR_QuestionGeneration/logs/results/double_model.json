According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year.\r\n\r\nMike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease.\r\n\r\n\"She really wanted to reach people all over the country,\" he said.\r\n\r\nGillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred \"Love Notes.\"\r\n\r\nAbby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,\" Aimee Love said. \"The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful.

Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise,\" Obama said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. president repeated his administration's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged \"concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama's remarks, delivered from State Dining Room, were the strongest yet from the United States. \"There must be reform,\" he said, \"political, social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In the absence of these reforms,\" he said, \"grievances have built up over time.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free and more hopeful,\" he concluded.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn his remarks, Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding. And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as \"hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, \"and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption.\" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported. A CNN witness saw the building ablaze.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said the collective consequences of the government's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Within that review is military\" assistance, Gibbs said.\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The die is cast,\" said Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said, \"we've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms\" but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We don't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together,\" Gelb said, cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government.\r\r\n\r\r\nOften considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East, Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal, a strategic passageway for trade across the region.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt's government \"to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters, and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces,\" Clinton said Friday, referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"At the same time, protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"As a partner, we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately,\" Clinton said. \"They need to view civil society as their partner, not a threat.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nServers of Egypt's main internet provider were down early Friday, including servers for the Egyptian government's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarly Friday, Gibbs said that he is \"very concerned about violence in Egypt,\" tweeting that the \"government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut at least one internet service provider, Noor, was still working.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to \"defer non-essential travel to Egypt.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes,\" the agency added in a written travel alert.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times,\" the statement said, urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone.\r\r\n\r\r\nDelta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday, and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Barack Obama has requested \"multiple briefings\" on Egypt, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the target of the protesters' anger, \"but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels, including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama's messages and concerns are relayed,\" Vietor said.\r\r\n\r\r\nFormer Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak \"without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think that, if anything, one might ask why hasn't President Mubarak called President Obama and said, 'Are you with me or against me?' I mean, that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration,\" Cohen said.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances,\" he said this week.\r\r\n\r\r\nVice President Joe Biden said on \"PBS NewsHour\" on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator.\r\r\n\r\r\nStill, Biden said, \"violence isn't appropriate, and people have a right to protest.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe noted Thursday that Mubarak has been \"very helpful on a range of tough issues,\" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Wednesday, Gibbs said the U.S. administration was \"monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so, obviously, in Tunisia.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali", "161": "a vehicle", "162": "the error \"an aberration", "163": "Rohingya", "164": "10", "165": "her acting chops", "166": "307", "167": "U.S. first lady Laura Bush", "168": "about 20", "169": "Michael Friel", "170": "three years ago", "171": "labor", "172": "$5 million", "173": "his guilty plea", "174": "No one could survive that crash", "175": "A US Air big DC-9 or -10", "176": "amputated", "177": "Roma and 2-1", "178": "Ben Gurion Airport", "179": "Ahmed", "180": "Erin Andrews", "181": "JAMAICA PLAIN, Massachusetts", "182": "Terry Shoemaker", "183": "February 13, 2009", "184": "pirates", "185": "committing", "186": "30-year rule", "187": "Greenpeace", "188": "Mirza", "189": "genocide", "190": "18", "191": "asphyxiated", "192": "Friday from a top former Clinton administration official and two former Democratic senators", "193": "80", "194": "posthumous column", "195": "biochar", "196": "Santiago, Chile", "197": "Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving", "198": "north-northwest motion", "199": "China's devastating earthquake.\r\n\r\nPolice officer Jiang Xiaojuan", "200": "shoes", "201": "\" Birthday Cake\"  and \" Cockiness (Love It)\"", "202": "future and hopes to soon immerse himself", "203": "$72.5 million", "204": "mail fraud", "205": "Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote.\n\nWaterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department.\n\nPresident Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales", "206": "Stonehenge was indeed a burial ground.\r\n\r\nBut people have debated the purpose of Stonehenge for decades.\r\n\r\nKnown for its orientation in relation to the rising and setting sun, the circle of stones represented a prehistoric temple to some.

Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites, for instance.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave. Another man's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot, one of his legs was found near a grave, a hip was found inside the grave, his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave.\r\n\r\n\"What we do here is we sort them out,\" said Katzmarzyk, the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker, simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together.  Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP's work \u00bb\r\n\r\nThen, a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives.\r\n\r\nBut DNA can only go so far, and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk's table are those of a man and his 22-year-old son, it cannot say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21-year-old or his 24-year-old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point.\r\n\r\nIt's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related. Across the room, brothers lie next to each other, but as yet the scientists do not know who is who.\r\n\r\nSo Katzmarzyk and her colleagues are also experts in forensic anthropology, using other pointers to make an identification.\r\n\r\nThey will look for clues to the age of the remains and any other factors that could identify them: Did the man break his leg as a child?

Over the years, he has been to more than 125 Grateful Dead concerts. The band literally changed his life.\r\n\r\nGoldfarb, who now makes moccasins for a living, is excited about the Grateful Dead's new tour.\r\n\r\nThe surviving members of the band will be reuniting for 19 shows this year. He went to see them during their last organized tour five years ago.\r\n\r\n\"What was special about the Dead is you had a group of highly talented musicians who were able to get a sense of the audience,\" Goldfarb said. \"When the audience was off, the band would be off. There was a lot of back-and-forth energy.\"\r\n\r\nBack in the late '70s and well into the '80s, Goldfarb traveled the West Coast in a Volkswagen van playing music for a belly-dancing troupe at Renaissance festivals. Along the way, he went to Grateful Dead concerts whenever he could.\r\n\r\nHe sent a photo of his now short-haired self to show the \"then and now\" contrast. Though he lives now in Woodstock, New York, he missed the two large music festivals in his town. A businessman now, Goldfarb says he feels he's grown up in a lot of ways.

Or rather, it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units, as they don't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful: nutrient-rich compost.\r\n\r\nEarthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly, in this context: The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus, which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting, according to CityFarmer.org. Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day, but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process, according to The Ecologist.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of them, too. You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land, according to NatureWatch, their population doubling in size every one-two months. And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves, stems and dead roots in one year, ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process.\r\n\r\nWhat they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients. According to NatureWatch, earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen, seven times as much phosphorous, 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more \"beneficial bacteria\" than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place. Literally speaking, what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out.\r\n\r\nUtilizing 'black gold'\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise why these worms' byproducts are often referred to as \"black gold,\" this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world's agricultural soil has become \"seriously degraded,\" according to the UK Soil Association.\r\n\r\nWorm compost:\r\n\r\nJust one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days, according to ScienceDaily. And plants love it. Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting, by as much as 40 percent for broccoli, 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots, according to The Ecologist.\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Waste Survey, compiled by Veolia Environmental Services, we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste", "447": "two of three", "448": "The Humane Society of the United States", "449": "Diane Sawyer", "450": "Joy?\r\n\r\nBehar: This Miss California girl, I think she's doing great", "451": "Moorhead", "452": "Economic", "453": "eased the protruding heart", "454": "Jordan", "455": "Illinois first lady Patricia Blagojevich", "456": "Jason Aldean", "457": "1,700 to 5,000", "458": "Jackson", "459": "Breaking the Silence", "460": "Frank Buckles", "461": "22", "462": "cut through red tape", "463": "blocked the search engine's camera car from photographing their homes", "464": "Martins", "465": "genius", "466": "The dog's weight will peak at about 25 pounds, enabling him seamlessly to sift between cramped luggage and lockers.

Passing the exam depends on his whiffing talents.\r\n\r\nUpon the instructor's command, Kaden's pencil-thin legs playfully trot along the damp grass to an oversize wall scattered with dozens of holes. His instructor has hidden black gunpowder wrapped in pantyhose in one of the holes.\r\n\r\nIf Kaden's nose sniffs out the gunpowder, he will immediately sit.\r\n\r\nKaden begins on the left side, quickly taking a zigzag pattern from one hole to another. His pace is methodical, a sniff for each hole. Soon he slows, pauses, inhales again and then sinks his tiny hindquarters to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"What a good boy,\" coo several of Kaden's trainers, stroking his sleek fur and rewarding him with one of his favorite treats, torn bits of venison jerky.\r\n\r\nAs Kaden nibbles on his treat, Schettler admits there are drawbacks to training basenjis. Basenjis don't have a furry coat to endure cold weather like a German shepherd.\r\n\r\nBasenjis are also a highly independent, stubborn breed with personalities similar to cats, making them difficult to train. Kaden's personality, however, is contrary to most basenjis. He was culled from a litter in Atlanta at 7 days old because of his unusual sociability with humans.\r\n\r\n\"At eight weeks, he was in the airport going up to people and running around like he owned the place,\" Schettler says.\r\n\r\nTraining detection dogs such as Kaden often begins during puppyhood so imprinting scent differentiation becomes innate, handlers say.

were \"terror operatives.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIn an e-mailed statement the Israel Defense Forces spokesman's office claimed their figures contained the names of 1,166 Palestinians killed in the conflict, called \"Operation Cast Lead.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Israeli military said 709 of them were \"identified as Hamas terror operatives, among them several from various other terror organizations.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe remaining, the statement claims, were comprised of 162 names who \"have not yet been attributed to any organization.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Furthermore, it has come to our

Lead.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe numbers presented by the Israeli military differ sharply from those reported by Palestinian sources. At the conclusion of the fighting, the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza had put the death toll at over 1,300, with the majority made up of non-combatants.\r\r\n\r\r\nMore recently the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) published a study that put the total death toll at 1,417, including 926 civilians of which 313 were children under the age of 18 and 116 women. It reports that the remainder was made of 255 \"non-combatant\" police officers and 236 who were took \"an active part in hostilities.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nJaber Wishah, a deputy director for PCHR told CNN his organization \"stands firmly on our published figures\" and that Israel's choice to classify police officers as combatants is \"illegal.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Such classification constitutes a willful violation of the principle of 'distinction' which is a key component of customary international law.

It now resides at University College London and is occasionally moved so Bentham can \"attend\" meetings.\r\n\r\nBentham didn't want for the Auto-Icon to feature a wax head; he actually carried around the glass eyes he wanted used in his preserved face for years before his death. However, the preservation process distorted his face, so the wax replica had to stand in.\r\n\r\nFor many years Bentham's real head sat between his feet in the Auto-Icon, but it was such a target for pranksters that it eventually had to be locked away.

On Friday, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai visited a hospital's closed intensive care unit that he said needed $30,000 to resume operating.\r\r\n\r\r\nDuring the celebrations, Mugabe announced that his controversial land reform would not be reversed. The program is designed to have white-owned farms given to blacks, and there have been violent seizures of such farms since the program began in 2000.  Watch Mugabe's birthday bash \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nHe emphasized that the country's \"indigenization program\" -- which forces all major foreign companies operating in Zimbabwe to have at least 51 percent black ownership -- will be carried out. It began last year and hasn't been implemented yet.\r\r\n\r\r\nMugabe's birthday falls on February 21 but his party loyalists postponed the celebrations as they were raising money for the event.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think it is going to be a great day for the legend and icon whose birthday we are celebrating today here,\" said Mugabe's nephew Patrick Zhuwawo, one of the fund-raisers for the birthday. \"The country might be having problems, but we need to have a day to honor the sacrifices the president has made for this country.\" What do you think about the celebrations?\r\r\n\r\r\nZhuwawo said about 100 beasts would be slaughtered for the birthday bash. iReport.com: What do you think about Mugabe's lavish party?\r\r\n\r\r\nMugabe also invited schoolchildren from around the country to attend the party, being held at Chinhoyi University.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe farming town of Chinhoyi is usually quiet, but Saturday's event has changed everything. Cars with Mugabe's supporters could be seen hooting and some ZANU-PF supporters sang Mugabe's praises.\r\r\n\r\r\nA banner in Chinhoyi read, \"Age ain't nothing but a number.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMugabe invited Tsvangirai, his new partner in a power-sharing government", "1320": "Philadelphia", "1321": "Cheryl Katzmarzyk", "1322": "three", "1323": "Gaborone, Botswana", "1324": "Mukasey", "1325": "next year", "1326": "775", "1327": "additional charges that she tried to poison two people", "1328": "The American people", "1329": "Scott Brown of Massachusetts", "1330": "John Briggs", "1331": "Chileans used \"improper terms", "1332": "a scientist", "1333": "The round-ups began May 28, days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate", "1334": "Los Angeles", "1335": "second", "1336": "white supremacy groups", "1337": "second", "1338": "diarrhoeal", "1339": "Lewis", "1340": "Saddam Hussein's eldest daughter", "1341": "Swiss justice authorities", "1342": "continued corruption", "1343": "Elizabeth Edwards", "1344": "the president's budget", "1345": "one", "1346": "63 percent", "1347": "the area", "1348": "iPhone", "1349": "right thigh bone", "1350": "1974", "1351": "the home", "1352": "criminals", "1353": "four", "1354": "Liam Gallagher", "1355": "at least 471", "1356": "Gerets", "1357": "Chai Feldblum", "1358": "Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala and Panama", "1359": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A suicide car bombing exploded outside the NATO headquarters in Afghanistan", "1360": "French independence", "1361": "Harlem's Apollo Theater", "1362": "300,000", "1363": "Hannelore Marianne Krause", "1364": "nine residents", "1365": "Michael Showalter", "1366": "One iReporter even opted for a floating lifestyle", "1367": "Seven", "1368": "America's Most Wanted", "1369": "Estudiantes", "1370": "a Roman boxer", "1371": "Friday", "1372": "iReport.com", "1373": "Ashridge Business School", "1374": "The wedding", "1375": "Headline News", "1376": "New York's Bruckner Expressway", "1377": "Saturday", "1378": "River", "1379": "levee", "1380": "Tirana", "1381": "Etienne Tshisekedi", "1382": "weak version of reform", "1383": "John Albert Gardner III", "1384": "lot of different clips, some of them which are clearly fabricated", "1385": "barricade", "1386": "early detection and treatment of mental illnesses", "1387": "Myanmar's military junta", "1388": "carjacking resulting", "1389": "India", "1390": "Belfast, Northern Ireland", "1391": "Eight", "1392": "movie service on Tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies.\r\n\r\nThe move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their TV sets and heading straight to the Web -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows.\r\n\r\nThe service, named Fancast XFINITY TV (formerly called TV Everywhere), is the biggest cable industry initiative to keep people from skipping traditional TV service in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"I watch TV online every day.

It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\r\n\r\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in \"Mad Men", "1651": "140 mph", "1652": "Jason Moran and his associate Pasquale Barboro", "1653": "17", "1654": "Todd Palin", "1655": "Sunday", "1656": "$199 price tag", "1657": "Obama needs to be wary of alienating teachers who can be his allies on education reform", "1658": "King fought and died", "1659": "Elizabeth Morowitz, Communications Professor", "1660": "a vital step", "1661": "hasn't really represented all of New Yorkers.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The fact is there are thousands and thousands of us out on the streets, and he's not really recognizing that we're a movement,\" Combelic told CNN on Saturday. \"We should be heard by New York politicians.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Saturday, New York protesters set up a second base at Washington Square Park. The park in Greenwich Village is about two miles north of Zuccotti Park, a private park that's been considered the main rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in the city.\r\r\n\r\r\nA rally was held in Washington Square, followed by a now-customary people's assembly to discuss the movement and an art show Saturday evening. Demonstrators won't stay overnight at Washington Square Park, unlike Zuccotti, because it is a municipal park with a midnight curfew.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs of 9 p.m., the New York Police Department did not report any related arrests.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe ambiguously defined movement against corporate greed and other social ills has spread to more than a dozen cities, spurred lately by support from unions and other groups.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Social and economic inequalities are the tipping point, and people are hungry for getting involved and trying to do something to change it,\" Jim Nichols, who has been involved in Occupy Atlanta protests, told CNN on Saturday. \"It's almost like, I want the American dream back.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEven before Bloomberg's comments Saturday, the effort was stirring a growing number of strong reactions from public figures.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Barack Obama, even as he defended the need for a vibrant financial sector, acknowledged that the protesters \"are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works.\" The No. 2 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, Eric Cantor, meanwhile, slammed what he called the \"growing mobs\" who he claimed were \"pitting ... Americans against Americans.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Saturday, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel backed the demonstrators -- whom he has been visiting regularly over the past three weeks -- for venting their frustrations and exercising their constitutional rights.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Their dreams are being shattered,\" Rangel told CNN's Don Lemon. \"They may be an inconvenience to a whole lot of people in that area, but people are going to sleep at night with an economic nightmare.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe New York Democrat urged \"more spiritual leaders\" to join a movement he claimed championed the poor and disadvantaged, saying \"there's no moral reason why they have to wait for something to catch on.\" He also dismissed criticism that the demonstrators don't have a coherent purpose, saying despite their varied issues and lack of organization, their sentiments are raw and real.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They don't have to know what the solution is,\" he said. \"There's one thing they know is (there's) something wrong when so many people are out of work, and we find the disparity with the very rich. ... Something is wrong.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nCombelic, the New York spokesman, said the movement chiefly is trying to showcase \"active democracy and (show that) everyone has a voice in government.\" He said the protests -- which have been associated with progressive causes -- are \"a rebuke of government, that includes the left and the right.\"", "1662": "a mark of respect", "1663": "cultural genocide", "1664": "Talk Asia", "1665": "Malaysia and Brunei", "1666": "Maseth", "1667": "George Hamilton's mother Anne", "1668": "Oxford Street in London", "1669": "spent fuel cooling pools of another nuclear power plant", "1670": "19.8 percent", "1671": "legal experts", "1672": "delaying", "1673": "4:00 a.m.", "1674": "their TV show", "1675": "Old Tappan", "1676": "first", "1677": "Amelia Earhart", "1678": "Obama", "1679": "New York", "1680": "the devices' Wi-Fi standard", "1681": "Barack Obama", "1682": "Clairemont", "1683": "$5 million", "1684": "Muslim country", "1685": "So, not a bad Easter weekend", "1686": "Abby Miller", "1687": "Calderon", "1688": "more than 65,000", "1689": "Barack Obama", "1690": "Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton", "1691": "Clinton", "1692": "millions", "1693": "sift through the area \"in order to make sure that no stone, no area, is left untouched where the child's remains were found,\" Nieves said.\r\n\r\n\"Significant finds have been made,\" he added. \"At this point, we cannot identify what items have been recovered.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge and Cindy Anthony were \"devastated\" upon learning a toddler's corpse had been found near their Orlando, Florida, home, attorney Brad Conway said, but the couple is waiting for authorities to confirm the body's identity.\r\n\r\n\"They're not grieving yet, because they don't know whose body this is, but if it is identified as Caylee they're going to go through that grieving process privately, and when they're ready to speak, they will,\" Conway told reporters.\r\n\r\nA utility worker discovered the remains in a plastic bag Thursday and alerted authorities.

General Assembly, where Obama called for international unity in attacking the world's challenges.\r\r\n\r\r\nAsked if he was expressing disappointment in the U.S. president, Ahmadinejad responded, \"We simply didn't expect him to say something that was ... was baseless.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier Friday evening Obama said \"Iran is on notice\" regarding its nuclear efforts, and that the international community is united in its opposition to Tehran's nuclear program.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They are going to have to make a choice: Are they willing to go down the path to greater prosperity and security for Iran, giving up the acquisition of nuclear weapons ... or will they continue down a path that is going to lead to confrontation,\" he said at a news conference at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama's comments came hours after Iran acknowledged the existence of a second uranium enrichment facility and ahead of next week's planned meeting between Iran and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members, plus Germany. The October 1 meeting will take place in Geneva, Switzerland.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama said he would not speculate on any course of action absent a satisfactory response from Iran.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Even countries who a year ago or six months ago might have been reluctant to even discuss things like sanctions,\" are starting to become concerned, Obama said.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama said his \"preferred course of action is to resolve this in a diplomatic fashion. It's up to the Iranians to respond.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. president said the conclusions about Iran's nuclear ambitions came as a result of the work of three intelligence agencies -- those of Britain, France and the United States. The work, Obama said, was done \"to make sure that we were absolutely confident about the situation there.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States has known about the unfinished site since the Bush administration, according to senior U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations. French intelligence officials were also aware of the facility for several months at least, a U.S. diplomatic source said.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt wasn't until Monday that Iran wrote a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency, revealing the existence of the underground facility on a military base near the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe facility is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges, which is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor but is sufficient to manufacture bomb-making material, according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter.\r\r\n\r\r\nIran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site, an agency spokesman said.\r\r\n\r\r\nOnce Iran alerted the IAEA, Obama began sharing U.S. intelligence on the nuclear site with allies, particularly with Russia and China in an effort to get those countries on board with new sanctions against Iran, the officials said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Friday that Iran admitted the existence of the \"new pilot fuel enrichment plant,\" prompting Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to respond at the G-20 economic summit.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the nonproliferation regime,\" Obama said, with Brown and Sarkozy standing at his side.

Watch old toys get new life \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nLast week, a six-story flagship store opened in Shanghai, China. And a real-life Malibu Dream House, a temporary home tricked out for Barbie's birthday -- including a chandelier made of her hair -- is currently on display in California.\r\r\n\r\r\nNot bad for a doll that, according to author Robin Gerber, was initially inspired by \"a sexually-themed gag toy for men.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe now-legendary doll was conceived by Ruth Handler, a daughter of Polish immigrants, said Gerber, author of the newly published \"Barbie and Ruth: The Story of the World's Most Famous Doll and the Woman Who Created Her.\" She and her husband, Elliott, owned Mattel until a scandal involving accusations of cooked books drove them out in 1975, Gerber said.\r\r\n\r\r\nHandler, who died in 2002, used to watch her own daughter, Barbara, play with paper dolls. Then, on a trip to Europe, Barbara became fascinated with a buxom doll that Gerber said was based on a female German cartoon character, named Lilli, who used sex to get what she wanted.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My guess is she didn't know what it was when she bought it,\" because at that point, four years after the Lilli doll's release, it had landed in European toy stores, the author explained. Handler took the doll back to the states and insisted Mattel designers get to work.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Who would have thought,\" Gerber said. Barbie was thought up by a woman and modeled on a cartoon character \"who was essentially a prostitute.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThough the men at Mattel, a company that had never sold dolls before, were skeptical at best, Handler proved to be \"a corporate genius,\" Gerber said. In the three years after Barbie's release, Mattel's worth grew to $200 million, doubling the value earned in the first 20 years of business.\r\r\n\r\r\nHandler's daughter, now Barbara Segal, 67, is a bit dumbfounded by all the hype.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's been quite an interesting ride,\" she said from her Los Angeles, California, area home. \"I can't believe this doll's created all of this.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBarbie's collector line (not what's seen on Wal-Mart shelves) is designed for the grown-ups who still relish Barbie. Many say Barbie is an antidote to adult woes, allowing them to recapture their youth and revisit simpler times. iReport.com: See, share Barbie collections\r\r\n\r\r\nThe woman behind Sandi Holder's Doll Attic in Union City, California, strolled through her 3,000-square-foot warehouse and one-of-a-kind Barbie museum, home to thousands of dolls, and spoke of the visitors who flock through her doors each year.  Tour an iReporter's Barbie dream house \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nShe says the doll can evoke powerful emotions and has seen visitors weep for a lost sibling or childhood friend. But Holder, 51, who gave up a nursing career to pursue her Barbie dream more than 20 years ago, said that while trips to the museum can be emotional, they're also full of laughter and stories.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"No one leaves without sharing a fond portion of their childhood with me,\" said Holder, who once snagged a record for selling a doll at auction for $27,600.\r\r\n\r\r\nBarbie, however, doesn't conjure up smiles for everyone", "2258": "depression", "2259": "Indonesia", "2260": "pushed out of Uganda", "2261": "increase", "2262": "Frank Buckles", "2263": "more locations", "2264": "Cell phone footage", "2265": "Customs officials said that tourists will be able to get the devices back when they leave the country", "2266": "a sunlight filter", "2267": "Paul Rieckhoff", "2268": "Ethan Sloop", "2269": "5,000", "2270": "three-year-old", "2271": "Michael Jackson", "2272": "14", "2273": "started the downward spiraling of the governor", "2274": "talk to reporters", "2275": "Miami", "2276": "about the next week", "2277": "Greenville, South Carolina", "2278": "improperly breaking down", "2279": "covered", "2280": "He'll be writing about his preparations and giving his views on athletics leading up to the Games.\r\n\r\nCNN -- May 20, 2008\r\n\r\nAthletes and non-athletes alike often have the dream of going to the Olympic Games -- it's the ultimate experience in sports.\r\n\r\nHe may have not finished the London Marathon, but Gilbert Tuhabonye has overcome greater setbacks.\r\n\r\nI am no exception and this year, I decided to go for it, but first I needed a qualifying time in the marathon. I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi.\r\n\r\nI trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.\r\n\r\nBy mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way.\r\n\r\nFinally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel. It was time to regroup and figure this out.\r\n\r\nThis was not the worse thing that has ever happened to me. I have survived worse situations.  Watch Gilbert Tuhabonye talk about his experiences \u00bb.\r\n\r\nI started to reflect upon the fact that every time I try and train hard for a marathon, something happens. Perhaps this is just not the right time for me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps God has something else in mind for me. I am being stubborn and pushing for something that is not supposed to be right now.\r\n\r\nNow, I am home in Austin, Texas some weeks later.  Watch Gilbert coaching his Gilbert's Gazelles \u00bb.\r\n\r\nThankfully, my hamstring was not torn.

Barack Obama.\n\n\"He says that high oil prices are not the problem, but only that they rose too quickly. He doesn't support new domestic production. He doesn't support new nuclear plants. He doesn't support more traditional use of coal, either,\" McCain said.\n\n\"So what does Sen. Obama support in energy policy? Well, for starters, he supported the energy bill of 2005 -- a grab bag of corporate favors that I opposed. And now he supports new taxes on energy producers. He wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas. If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea too -- and a lot of good it did us.\"\n\nMcCain argues that a windfall profits tax will only increase the country's dependence on foreign oil and be an obstacle to domestic exploration.\n\n\"I'm all for recycling -- but it's better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s,\" he said.\n\nObama on Tuesday blasted McCain for changing his stance on offshore drilling.\n\n\"John McCain's support of the moratorium on offshore drilling during his first presidential campaign was certainly laudable, but his decision to completely change his position and tell a group of Houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear today was the same Washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades,\" he said.\n\n\"It's another example of short-term political posturing from Washington, not the long-term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also criticized McCain's plan, saying it would ruin his state's tourism industry and would not solve the problem.\n\n\"I thought John McCain was serious when he said he wanted to make America less dependent on oil. I didn't think he was a flip-flopper. He knows that more drilling isn't the solution to high gas prices,\" Nelson said Tuesday.\n\nObama said a windfall profits tax would ease the burden of energy costs on working families. He also wants to invest in affordable, renewable energy sources.\n\nControversy over offshore drilling surfaced in the United States in 1969, after a crack in the seafloor led to a huge oil spill off Santa Barbara, California.\n\nDuring the 1970s, when many Arab nations launched an oil embargo, many", "2685": "the veracity of the Holocaust", "2686": "Jesus Christ", "2687": "Mustafa Tamimi", "2688": "Italian", "2689": "Democratic strategist", "2690": "Good Morning America", "2691": "two car bombs", "2692": "Mark Morgan", "2693": "language issues, repetitive movements and difficulties", "2694": "CNN", "2695": "a prostitute's services and were caught by police", "2696": "Fabian Cancellara", "2697": "Petters Group Worldwide", "2698": "19 injured", "2699": "Robert Gates", "2700": "Roland Martin", "2701": "less than 120 seconds", "2702": "yo-yo", "2703": "space-age topography", "2704": "Capt.

Lack of funding can be just as serious, as the case of the California state parks demonstrates.\r\n\r\nThe sites are listed in alphabetical order:\r\n\r\nBoyd Theater, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Art Deco movie palace known as the Sameric was closed in 2002 and is for sale. A local group, Friends of the Boyd, is trying to save the 1928 theater, the last of its kind in Philadelphia. Only a few elaborate theaters from that era have survived, and the Boyd was the only one built in the downtown area. Moe said a \"sympathetic developer\" could restore the theater.\r\n\r\nCalifornia's park system The largest state park system in the United States suffers from chronic underfunding, including $1.2 billion worth of deferred maintenance, the National Trust said. The problem is worsening because of California's budget crisis. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger submitted a budget proposal this year that would have closed 48 parks, but the National Trust said the revised budget restored $11.8 million of the $13.3 million in cuts he requested.\r\n\r\nCurrent funds cover only 40 percent of maintenance and operations, which means irreplaceable historic and cultural resources remain endangered, the National Trust said. The system includes 278 parks, 1.5 million acres and 295 miles of ocean front. Many parks house historic buildings such as the 1820s-era Franciscan La Purisima Mission complex near Lompoc.\r\n\r\nCharity Hospital and adjacent neighborhood, New Orleans, Louisiana Charity Hospital, once the main trauma center for southeastern Louisiana, was closed after Hurricane Katrina swamped New Orleans in 2005. The building was declared unsalvageable, according to Donald R. Smithburg, chief executive of Louisiana State University Health Care Services Division, which operates university hospitals. There are plans to demolish nearly 200 homes in the Mid-City neighborhood to accommodate construction of two new hospitals. Alternate locations for the new hospitals are available, and Charity Hospital could be rehabilitated, according to the National Trust.\r\n\r\nGreat Falls Portage, Great Falls, Montana This National Historic Landmark is one of the best-preserved landscapes along the Lewis and Clark Trail, but a massive coal-fired power plant is planned in the area. \"Development abutting the Great Falls Portage, an undeveloped rural area under panoramic blue Montana skies, will irreparably harm the cultural and visual landscape,\" the National Trust said\r\n\r\nHangar One, Moffett Field, Santa Clara County, California The hangar was built in 1932 to house U.S. Navy dirigibles. It is a cavernous, 200-foot-tall, dome-shaped structure sitting on more than 8 acres. A 2003 inspection revealed carcinogenic PCBs leaking from the hangar's metallic exterior, the National Trust said. PCBs were widely used in electrical transformers. The Navy transferred Hangar One to NASA in 1992. Although the Navy remains responsible for environmental remediation, it is not required to preserve the building.\r\n\r\nLower East Side, New York The Lower East Side in southeast Manhattan was home for immigrants and the working class in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is becoming gentrified. Development threatens historic churches, theaters, schools and tenements, \"a unique architectural type which, by the sheer numbers who lived in such a building, had an impact on more Americans than any other form of urban housing,\" the National Trust said.\r\n\r\nMichigan Avenue Streetwall, Chicago, Illinois This 12-block stretch of historic buildings along Michigan Avenue between 11th and Randolph Streets dates back to the early 1880s. The streetwall is a collection of notable buildings by architects including Adler & Sullivan, Louis Sullivan, D. H. Burnham and Holabird & Roche, the National Trust said. Although the stretch was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002, the National Trust says its historic character is threatened by the inappropriate addition of large-scale towers that retain only small portions of the original buildings or their facades.\r\n\r\nPeace Bridge Neighborhood, Buffalo, New York The bridge and neighborhood, which has homes and buildings dating to the 1850s, includes two parks on the National Register of Historic Places that are part of Frederick Law Olmsted's park system.

The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday is searching for two fishermen missing after a commercial fishing vessel went down in remote, treacherous waters off the Aleutian Islands about 1,400 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nThe fishing vessel Courageous helps search for missing men in waters off Alaska.\n\nFour of the boat's crew members were rescued and five bodies retrieved Wednesday near the Amchitka Pass, a strait that connects the Bering Sea to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe names have been withheld pending the notification of families, a Coast Guard statement said.\n\n\"What can you say?\" said Jeff DeBell, chief financial officer of Katmai Fisheries, which owned the boat. He told The Associated Press, \"We are devastated by what has happened. We are elated there have been survivors. We are just terribly saddened by the ones that are dead and are praying that those that are still in the water are alive.\"\n\nThe Seattle-based company told the AP the survivors were Capt. Henry Blake and crew members Guy Schroeder, Adam Foster and Harold Attling.\n\nThe search began at about 1 a.m. Wednesday when the Coast Guard received an emergency signal from the Katmai, a 93-foot fishing vessel that had been battling 50-knot winds and nearly 20-foot waves.\n\nThe signal originated from a wall-mounted satellite positioning device on the Katmai that reacts when it's touched or splashed with water, Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read said.  Watch a \"Deadliest Catch\" captain talk about what may have happened on the rough seas \u00c2\u00bb\n\nAt about that time, another vessel, the Blue Balard, sent an e-mail to the Coast Guard saying that it received a message from the Katmai that water was flooding its rear compartment. The message also said that the vessel had lost steering.\n\nThe Coast Guard tried to e-mail the Balard back but received no response, likely because the seas are remote and Internet access can be spotty, Read said.\n\nRescuers launched a C-130", "3015": "Midfielder Simone Pepe", "3016": "Rohingya have been dumped at sea by the Thai army", "3017": "two of Shell's pipelines", "3018": "Dear #Facebook", "3019": "his young fans get energized about the election when they can't even vote", "3020": "50-meter equine artwork", "3021": "the world a unique voice", "3022": "People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran", "3023": "Pahrump, Nevada", "3024": "John Kiriakou", "3025": "second", "3026": "Oxford Street in London", "3027": "document forgery", "3028": "The View", "3029": "police bail", "3030": "a preference to both parties having skin in the game", "3031": "4 a.m.", "3032": "the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief", "3033": "LZ Granderson", "3034": "at home", "3035": "an assassination attempt on the Venezuelan leader during a short-lived coup in 2002.

They received the order to kill me. However, at this very moment, a group of soldiers refused. They did not kill me, but I saw those who wanted to kill me, and the order came from the White House.\"\r\n\r\nChavez also expressed concern that the United States, which he calls \"the empire,\" still would like to topple him. As he has numerous times in recent weeks, Chavez criticized U.S. plans to begin operating out of military bases in neighboring Colombia. The United States says it needs a presence in Colombia to fight drug traffickers. Chavez sees a sinister intent.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what country he fears would harm him, Chavez replied, \"The empire. The empire. Seven military bases ... in Colombia, that's a serious threat against Venezuela.\"\r\n\r\nChavez also defended his relationship with Iran but denied having said that Iran would help Venezuela obtain nuclear technology. Iran has embarked on a nuclear program that the United States and other nations think will lead it to develop nuclear weapons before long.\r\n\r\n\"They have fooled you,\" Chavez said. \"I've never said that Iran is going to help us to have nuclear technology. ... That's a strategy to attack Venezuela and say that we are building an atomic bomb. That's the next accusation. And I'm going to say this now: Please, come on. That's crazy. That's crazy.\"\r\n\r\nChavez said he does not agree with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contention that the Holocaust, in which 6 million European Jews were killed during World War II, never existed.\r\n\r\n\"But there also was another holocaust in South America,\" Chavez said. \"I do not deny the Jewish Holocaust. And I condemn it. But in South America, when the Europeans arrived, there were close to 90 million Indians; 200 years later, we only had four million remaining. That was a holocaust. And the Europeans denied this holocaust.\"\r\n\r\nIsrael came under criticism from Chavez, who called it a \"small country with atomic bombs, and very aggressive country. ...

Awad told CNN the delegation traveled to Tehran at the invitation of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe appeal for the release of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal began with a series of personal letters addressed to Ahmadinejad and other Iranian leaders in September 2010, CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn May, boxing legend Muhammad Ali joined more than a dozen prominent Muslim American and various interfaith leaders -- including CAIR -- at a news conference in Washington to publicly ask for the release of the two hikers.\r\r\n\r\r\nTheir appeal to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khameni, was endorsed by the group, which has maintained a dialogue with clerical leaders in Iran, said Awad.\r\r\n\r\r\nLast week, Awad and three other members of the delegation, boarded a flight to Tehran with a stop in Istanbul, Turkey.\r\r\n\r\r\nTheir visit this week included meetings with Iranian religious scholars and leaders in the holy city of Qom and a meeting on Saturday with Ahmadinejad, said Awad.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We can only hope the two men are freed soon on humanitarian grounds and that our visit fosters a better dialogue between Iranian and American leaders of faith,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe delegation was granted permission by government officials to visit Baur and Fattal in prison on Sunday but their request was postponed, said Awad.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe delegation also met with family members of Iranian citizens held in the United States adding that government officials there emphasized the need to work more effectively at \"securing the freedom of Iranians in American jails,\" Awad said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe two men, along a third hiker, Sarah Shourd, were arrested and taken into custody along the Iran-Iraq border in July 2009 and charged with espionage.

It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost.\r\n\r\nWithout clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified.\r\n\r\nIt's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in? Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real-life battle against cancer.\r\n\r\nFans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah (Lena Headey) in the new reality. Did she follow her son into the future? If not, what happened to her?\r\n\r\nFriedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now. He packs episodes with twists you don't see coming but make sense in retrospect. He changes up his style, drops lead characters for entire episodes, uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that's simultaneously believable and eloquent. He lets major characters die. And the show's directors coax subtle, nuanced performances from the actors.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't guess any of this from Fox's promotions, which have focused too heavily on Cameron (Summer Glau), the robot who helps protect John Connor (Thomas Dekker), sending the signal that it's a show just for teenage fanboys. Cameron and John's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize: the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life. It's in some ways the reverse of \"Buffy.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Fox may have done better promoting \"Chronicles\" as a family drama and then pairing it with one, rather than \"Dollhouse,\" the latest from \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon. (Insider question for fans: Is Josh Friedman the new Joss Whedon? Weigh in here or here.)\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear how, or if, the new movie \"Terminator: Salvation\" affects the show's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines, there's apparently no overlap and no conflict.\r\n\r\nThe weekly adventures of Sarah and John Connor just aren't done. There's too much unanswered, too much left to explore. So here's my pitch to network heads: You can still change the future. Don't terminate these \"Chronicles\" before their time.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts", "3422": "Broughton, north of London", "3423": "The tomb", "3424": "denied reports that armed groups were trying to re-establish a foothold in the area", "3425": "first", "3426": "a mangled hulk", "3427": "compensatory", "3428": "any related arrests", "3429": "new product launches", "3430": "millions", "3431": "183", "3432": "a Latina racist.\"\r\n\r\nTo lift one statement out of Judge Sotomayor's eight-page speech without examining the context and substance of her remarks, is an example of the kind of shoddy character assassination that I suspect will dominate this judicial confirmation process.\r\n\r\nJudge Sotomayor's speech is, in fact, an excellent meditation on how the experiences of judges might affect how they approach aspects of judicial decision-making. It explores the important, and too-little examined reality that judicial deliberations can be affected by a judge's background, perspective and experience.\r\n\r\nIn the next sentence immediately following the passage above, Judge Sotomayor says, \"Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice [Benjamin] Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society.\"\r\n\r\nCould she have been referring to Buck v. Bell, the 1927 case in which Justice Holmes -- widely regarded as perhaps the most brilliant justice in the Supreme Court's history -- upheld the state's plan to sterilize Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old white woman, who was accused of being congenitally retarded. Buck's main crime seems to have been the fact that she'd had a child out of wedlock.\r\n\r\nIn any case, Justice Holmes upheld the sterilization order, emphatically and coldly stating, \"three generations of imbeciles is enough.\" Does anyone seriously believe that a woman, and especially a woman of color \"with the richness of her experiences\" would not have \"reach[ed] a better conclusion \" than that adopted by Justice Holmes in 1927?\r\n\r\nIn fact Buck v. Bell is the perfect example of how a \"wise old [white] man\" got it wrong in a way that a woman judge or a racial minority most likely would not.\r\n\r\nIt's worth pointing out that in that same speech Judge Sotomayor cautioned, \"we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group.\" But she acknowledges that \"there may be some [difference in her judging] based on my gender and my Latina heritage.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Gingrich and others decry in Judge Sotomayor should be applauded.

Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the historian at the National First Ladies' Library, points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed, liked European style and had American designers copy it. She even went as far as to personally design her own outfits on three important state occasions, including her famous White House dinner for Nobel laureates, while letting other designers take the credit.\r\n\r\nThe comparisons between Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Obama are as apt as the comparisons between their husbands. Michelle Obama comes across as feminine yet strong, professional and, unlike Mrs. Kennedy, approachable.

Finally, something did show up -- but not the finale.\r\n\r\nIn the place where the show should have been, Wallen, 24, and his friends found a one-minute preview of the finale that ended simply with a title screen bearing the date \"March 10,\" the day the show will be available on demand.\r\n\r\nLike thousands of other \"Wire\" fanatics who had similarly flocked to the presumed early screener Sunday night, the group sat stunned.\r\n\r\n\"It completely killed the whole weekend,\" Wallen said. \"We are diehard fans who have watched it every week -- a week early. We didn't think this week would be any different.\"\r\n\r\nThe finale of \"The Wire\" has earned intense interest from fans who have followed the Baltimore-set show zealously since its premiere in 2002. The critically lauded show has never matched the audience of other HBO programs, such as \"The Sopranos,\" but its viewers are a particularly passionate lot, following the show's motley crew of cops, drug dealers, struggling children, politicians and journalists with deeply probing blogs and running commentary.

Tour an iReporter's Barbie dream house \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nShe says the doll can evoke powerful emotions and has seen visitors weep for a lost sibling or childhood friend. But Holder, 51, who gave up a nursing career to pursue her Barbie dream more than 20 years ago, said that while trips to the museum can be emotional, they're also full of laughter and stories.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"No one leaves without sharing a fond portion of their childhood with me,\" said Holder, who once snagged a record for selling a doll at auction for $27,600.\r\r\n\r\r\nBarbie, however, doesn't conjure up smiles for everyone.\r\r\n\r\r\nThough the 11.5-inch doll can't be single-handedly blamed for the eating disorders and body-image issues that plague young women, Ellyn Kaschak, a psychology professor at San Jose Sate University in California, said Barbie, especially given her prevalence, is part of the problem.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I don't think the concerns are overblown at all,\" said Kaschak, one of the founders in the 1970s of the feminist psychology field. \"Blow her up to normal [human] size, and she'd fall over,\" she said of Barbie's unattainable figure.\r\r\n\r\r\nStill standing, however, is Cindy Jackson, a 53-year-old woman inspired by Barbie to do much more than collect dolls and splurge on matching outfits.\r\r\n\r\r\nOver the course of more than two decades, Jackson has gone under the knife for 13 full-scale operations, including multiple procedures each time, and hundreds of less intrusive cosmetic tune-ups in order to achieve the \"all-American beauty\" look she said Barbie represents.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe grew up in rural Ohio, \"plain and unpopular,\" she said. \"Every real woman around me was a farmer's wife, a factory worker, a mother or a school teacher. ... For me, it was soul-destroying. There was no glamour whatsoever.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd then she met her first Barbie, a vintage doll sporting a bubble cut, \"a sidelong glance\" and dressed as Jackie Kennedy, she remembered.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It was powerful,\" Jackson said from her London, England, home. \"I'd never seen a real woman who looked like that, and I thought, 'That's what I want to look like.' \"\r\r\n\r\r\nConcern about Barbie's looks and her values, including materialism -- she has worn about 1 billion outfits, Mattel's Dougherty said -- has at times gained ire from more than feminists and psychologists. The recent release of Tattoo Barbie, for instance, has gotten under the skin of some parents.  Watch video about the controversy \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nBut such criticism misses the point of what Barbie is all about, according to diehard fans. iReport.com: Barbie's body is not the issue\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's not about wanting to look like her. It's about imagining what could be,\" said Nancy Parsons, of western Pennsylvania, who is chairwoman of the Barbie 50th Anniversary Gala, this year's collectors convention planned for July. \"People who say it's a bad influence -- they don't know the imagination that goes into playing with dolls. ... My sister always pretended she was a nurse, and [now] she's a nurse.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAll told, Barbie has held down 108 careers, Mattel says. She's been a police officer, a doctor, a veterinarian, an astronaut and a presidential candidate.\r\r\n\r\r\nWomen, by the way, are not the only ones drawn to Barbie. Up to 20 percent of annual convention attendees, who fly in from all over the world, are men, this year's chairwoman, Parsons, said. In her own collector's club there are two of them: \"One's a hair dresser, and one's an auto mechanic,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nScott Warren, 45, of Orlando, Florida, will attend his seventh consecutive annual convention this summer.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe \"novice fashion fan,\" as he described himself, has been collecting Barbies for about 14 years and counts among his favorites his Versace Barbie, Ralph Lauren Barbie and Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg Barbie.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I know there's no way I can afford a designer's original, but I think it's cool that my Barbies can,\" he said.

killed 925 people and wounded 2,605, a top government official said Wednesday.\r\n\r\nIraqis mourn outside the Sadr City hospital Wednesday after several people were killed in clashes.\r\n\r\nMost of the casualties consist of civilians and \"criminal elements attacked by us,\" said Tahseen al-Sheikhly, a spokesman for the Baghdad security crackdown called Operation Enforcing the Law.\r\n\r\nCivilians are being caught in the crossfire because militants \"use the population to cover themselves,\" al-Sheikhly said.\r\n\r\nThe number of Iraqi civilians killed and wounded nationwide continued to increase during April. According to Iraq's Interior Ministry, 969 civilians died and 1,750 were wounded during April. In March, the total was 923 civilians killed and 1,358 wounded -- a sharp increase over February, when 633 died and 701 were wounded.\r\n\r\nDespite Shiite militants' calls for the Iraqi government to honor a cease-fire, al-Sheikhly said, the crackdown on insurgents will end when the insurgency ends.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there is a timetable for all this. I can't tell that this will end tomorrow or the day after,\" he said. The attacks \"will end when those aspects of violence end.\"\r\n\r\nHe echoed sentiments expressed earlier in the day by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who said the government will not accept the existence of a nongovernment armed force.\r\n\r\nWord of the casualties came as the U.S. military said its highest death toll in seven months reflected an effort by Iraqi militants to reassert themselves after weeks of government crackdowns.

The first incident occurred about 1 a.m. during a walking patrol in northern Baghdad, the military said.\r\n\r\nThe other two died about 4:50 p.m. when an improvised explosive device detonated in southern Baghdad, the military said. Names of the soldiers were withheld pending notification of their relatives.\r\n\r\nAnother U.S. soldier died Wednesday in a bombing in the northern Iraqi province of Ninevah, according to the military.\r\n\r\nThe deaths bring the April death toll for the U.S. military to 50, the highest monthly tally since September. Most of the deaths occurred in and around Baghdad, and most were combat-related.\r\n\r\nSince the war in Iraq began, in March 2003, 4,062 U.S. service members have died.\r\n\r\nOver the past several weeks, militants have increased mortar and rocket", "4805": "February 24, 2010", "4806": "The judge", "4807": "Antoin Rezko", "4808": "Iraq", "4809": "your services, your family", "4810": "sympathize", "4811": "14", "4812": "an emotional Kiley Barnes", "4813": "100 yards", "4814": "A Little Night Music.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oscar-winning star of \"Chicago\" will appear alongside Angela Lansbury in a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical \"A Little Night Music,\" according to an announcement from the show's producers.\r\n\r\nThe production is set to open December 13 at the Walter Kerr Theater", "4815": "sense of the physical world", "4816": "Nebraska", "4817": "sparkling", "4818": "sick with worry", "4819": "Eight", "4820": "the Jackson 5", "4821": "felony conspiracy counts", "4822": "in a hail of bullets", "4823": "FMLN", "4824": "February 13, 2009", "4825": "the breakdown of law and order in Somalia", "4826": "Susan Boyle", "4827": "abuse", "4828": "the officer", "4829": "Thirty-three percent of the Medicaid population smokes, compared with 20% of the U.S. population", "4830": "Manchester United and England", "4831": "silver", "4832": "Turkish Arab family", "4833": "Michael Jackson", "4834": "oceans", "4835": "northern Baghdad", "4836": "bones", "4837": "should add up to continued box office success", "4838": "NEW YORK", "4839": "basketball", "4840": "plea", "4841": "Bear Grylls", "4842": "World News", "4843": "lumpectomies", "4844": "Lamaze", "4845": "monosodium glutamate is completely banned", "4846": "a unified Burma", "4847": "autism and related disorders", "4848": "every house", "4849": "Jena Six", "4850": "Friday", "4851": "June of 1993", "4852": "hotel peepholes", "4853": "300", "4854": "The action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way", "4855": "East Asian", "4856": "wealth, youth and glamor to an adoring middle class", "4857": "increases an individual's cancer risk by 0.02 percent", "4858": "Israel fired the chemical agent white phosphorus in civilian areas", "4859": "change the office's two-term limit to allow him to run for a third term", "4860": "home ground", "4861": "broken glass", "4862": "United Airlines Flight 93 memorial", "4863": "Nabi Saleh", "4864": "Chen", "4865": "high-definition camera", "4866": "Seminole Hard Rock Hotel", "4867": "Vox Pop", "4868": "Ambassador to Iraq", "4869": "the bowels", "4870": "the National Archives", "4871": "a State Department employee having sex", "4872": "NATO's Afghanistan headquarters", "4873": "Indian", "4874": "the allegations made by these attorneys", "4875": "Venezuelan", "4876": "Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab", "4877": "every aspect of struggling hotels, motels and bed & breakfasts", "4878": "13,200", "4879": "people in more affluent demographics are 25 percent more likely to be found friending on Facebook", "4880": "Gus Van Sant's \"Elephant", "4881": "milkshake", "4882": "An armored personnel vehicle", "4883": "Talk That Talk", "4884": "Facebook profiles", "4885": "the National Park Service says they will put up signs and run educational outreach", "4886": "the Indian government", "4887": "30 years ago", "4888": "an alleged desecration of pages in the Quran, the Muslim sacred text", "4889": "leave its longtime home", "4890": "30,000", "4891": "Wolverine", "4892": "a car accident", "4893": "\"\r\n\r\nReich, whose relationship with the Clintons dates back to their law school days at Yale, has long been a critic of the New York senator's White House bid.

specialist at Purdue University who has advised two U.S. presidents and numerous companies and government agencies.\r\n\r\nCyber crime is one of the few industries benefiting from the financial crisis. Last year, antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined. In the United States, the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year.\r\n\r\nCompanies lost an average of $4.6 million in intellectual property last year, according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by Purdue University and McAfee.\r\n\r\n\"As the economy has declined, we've seen the threat landscape increase,\" David DeWalt, president and CEO of McAfee, recently told Richard Quest for CNN International's \"Quest Means Business.\"\r\n\r\nThat increase has helped antivirus makers such as McAfee snare record returns -- the company's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year.\r\n\r\nBut companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with Web-savvy criminals, experts say.\r\n\r\n\"The fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains,\" said Michael Fraser, director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.\r\n\r\n\"They have R&D departments, strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal,\" Fraser said.\r\n\r\nOn these Web sites, would-be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own \"botnet\" -- referring to software that can, unbeknownst to victims, turn their computers into spamming foot-soldiers for criminal networks. One Web site advertises software that can capture information for a popular Internet secured-payment provider for $500 -- discounted to $400 for the first 100 buyers.\r\n\r\nSkimmed credit card numbers and other personal-identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on Web sites, Fraser said. \"When police shut these Web sites down", "5080": "abuse", "5081": "Renee Zellweger", "5082": "Adam Sandler", "5083": "complications of cosmetic surgery", "5084": "15", "5085": "food stamps", "5086": "3-year-old", "5087": "2008 Summer Olympics", "5088": "At least six", "5089": "Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus", "5090": "The arrests were part of a large police operation", "5091": "Robert Baden-Powell", "5092": "Luxembourg", "5093": "CNN", "5094": "the Sydney", "5095": "a month-long pilot program", "5096": "lifting the ban", "5097": "vehicular homicide", "5098": "pizza sub", "5099": "John Salsberg", "5100": "the cable provider company", "5101": "five to eight", "5102": "Human Rights Watch", "5103": "a total waste of money", "5104": "1864", "5105": "30 pounds", "5106": "The goats", "5107": "Maryland officials wanted an eco-friendly solution that wouldn't hurt the area's bog turtles", "5108": "Yemen", "5109": "strangling his wife and two young sons", "5110": "three", "5111": "Wallen", "5112": "her nation's cuisine", "5113": "So Obama's current rating certainly does not indicate that he is out of the woods yet", "5114": "185", "5115": "a suspected pirate attack", "5116": "$128 million", "5117": "Abdul Aleem Abdulwahab and Lazem Mohammed Ali", "5118": "Barcelona", "5119": "Duprevil", "5120": "Multiple people", "5121": "Miss Pistols", "5122": "Britain", "5123": "184", "5124": "32 ounces", "5125": "Kate Gosselin"}
