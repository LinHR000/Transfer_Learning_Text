I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ...

I just shake my head and say, \"Isn't that something?\" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's ahead of us?\r\n\r\nAlexander: Oh my goodness, so much.

Those other airlines did go through Chapter 11 during (past) recessions and they managed to slash their costs.\r\r\n\r\r\nSo now American has been struggling for the last few years trying to negotiate, trying to get agreements, trying to get its costs down.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut frankly, with oil prices high, with growth slowing down, and with so many other competitive disadvantages, incoming CEO Thomas Horton told me a short while ago they really had no choice.

You can't just have, let's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday or a day of service. We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year.\r\n\r\nWe need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ... But without that kind of family support, then we need Boys and Girls Clubs. We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We need mentors. Otherwise, these kids will find bad adults to copy from, and we're going to lose them.\r\n\r\nLemon: I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me.\r\n\r\nLemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort?\r\n\r\nPowell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe've got to teach them that you've got to behave.

And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz", "397": "Mary L.

First, tablet users tend to be more highly educated: Fifty-one percent have a college degree, compared with 28% of all Americans.\r\r\n\r\r\nTablet users also tend to be richer: Fifth-three percent have an annual household income greater than $75,000, compared with 28% of the total U.S. population. (Conversely, 15% of tablet users have an annual household income of less than $30,000, while over a third of American households earn that much or less each year.)\r\r\n\r\r\nMost tablet users have jobs: Sixty-two percent are employed full time, compared with 41% of the total population.\r\r\n\r\r\nAlong other demographic lines, tablets mostly mirror the general population in terms of gender, race and political ideology. But age indicates some differences: Nearly half (46%) of tablet users are age 30-49, while just 35% of Americans are in that age bracket. Also, only 7% of tablet owners are age 65 or older, while 17% of Americans are seniors.

The project notes: \"About half (53%) get news on their tablet every day, and they read long articles as well as get headlines.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMany news organizations are building and promoting their own apps specifically designed for tablets. The project found that about two-thirds of tablet users have a news app installed on their tablets, but that's not where they get most of their news, even on the tablet.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The browser, carried over from the desktop experience, is still the more popular means of consuming news,\" said the report. \"A plurality of tablet news users (40%) say they get their news mainly through a Web browser.

But officials on Sunday were still trying to determine a motive.\n\nZikuski said the first 911 calls were in \"broken English,\" and dispatchers \"could not determine what was the problem.\" But two minutes after the first calls, officers were being dispatched to the civic association, and the first units arrived one minute later, the chief said.\n\nHe said in these types of situations officers have orders to enter a building if shooting is still happening inside, but in this case the shooting had stopped. At 10:38 a.m., one of the wounded called with a description of the gunman. The department's tactical squad did not move in until 11:13 a.m., Zikuski said.\n\nMollen said the issue of the police response was \"an obvious question\" that will be investigated, but \"now's not the time.\"\n\n\"We need a lot more information before any reasoned, intelligent response can be given to you,\" he said.\n\nThose who knew Wong said they were not surprised by his actions, Zikuski said Saturday.\n\n\"Some of this behavior on his [Wong's] part wasn't a total shock,\" the chief said.\n\n\"Apparently people were making fun of him. He felt he was being degraded because of his inability to speak English, and he was upset about that,\" Zikuski said.\n\nWong came to the United States in the late 1980s and lived in Binghamton before moving to California in the early 1990s, police said. He returned to Binghamton in July 2007, Zikuski said.\n\nWong became a U.S. citizen in 1995 and married and divorced while living in California, where he had been convicted on a misdemeanor charge of writing bad checks, according to Zikuski.\n\nPolice found at the center two semi-automatic handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9 mm, licensed to Wong. The guns were purchased locally, and Wong made trips to a firing range \"at least once a week, sometimes more than that,\" Zikuski said.\n\nWong had attempted to purchase \"a number of firearms,\" the chief said. Purchasing a gun in New York takes about two weeks, Zikuski said, and Wong would return to a store during that period, \"cancel that order and purchase another one.\"\n\nWong was wearing body armor during the shooting. Investigators are \"looking into that\" because New York limits body armor purchases to law enforcement, Zikuski said.\n\nFunerals for two victims were held Sunday afternoon at a local mosque.\n\nAn interfaith memorial service for all the victims was held Sunday evening, and hundreds of people took part in a candlelight vigil afterward.

The park in Greenwich Village is about two miles north of Zuccotti Park, a private park that's been considered the main rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in the city.\r\r\n\r\r\nA rally was held in Washington Square, followed by a now-customary people's assembly to discuss the movement and an art show Saturday evening.

Americans against Americans.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Saturday, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel backed the demonstrators -- whom he has been visiting regularly over the past three weeks -- for venting their frustrations and exercising their constitutional rights.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Their dreams are being shattered,\" Rangel told CNN's Don Lemon. \"They may be an inconvenience to a whole lot of people in that area, but people are going to sleep at night with an economic nightmare.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe New York Democrat urged \"more spiritual leaders\" to join a movement he claimed championed the poor and disadvantaged, saying \"there's no moral reason why they have to wait for something to catch on.\" He also dismissed criticism that the demonstrators don't have a coherent purpose, saying despite their varied issues and lack of organization, their sentiments are raw and real.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They don't have to know what the solution is,\" he said. \"There's one thing they know is (there's) something wrong when so many people are out of work, and we find the disparity with the very rich. ... Something is wrong.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nCombelic, the New York spokesman, said the movement chiefly is trying to showcase \"active democracy and (show that) everyone has a voice in government.\" He said the protests -- which have been associated with progressive causes -- are \"a rebuke of government, that includes the left and the right.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We're trying to broaden the discussion base. ... We're trying to represent 99% of the country that's felt disenfranchised over the past five years because of the recession,\" Combelic said. \"(Politicians) have not come together, they've not compromised on anything, and there's a reason why there's (low) congressional approval in this country.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe demonstrations have been largely peaceful. But in New York, some have been marred by scuffles with police.\r\r\n\r\r\nLast Saturday, police made hundreds of arrests as demonstrators marched without a permit toward the Brooklyn Bridge, blocking city traffic for hours", "826": "June 25", "827": "a scandal", "828": "Albanian", "829": "five years", "830": "Michael Bloomberg", "831": "14,000", "832": "Mariah, Madonna, and newcomer Leona Lewis", "833": "Tsvangirai is not obligated to attend", "834": "South Carolina", "835": "Penny", "836": "They are still friends.

There are Gay Pride celebrations, and then there are Black Gay Prides.\r\n\r\nThere's a popular bar in the heart of the nation's capital that might as well rename itself Antebellum, because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor. Last year at the annual Human Rights Campaign national fundraiser in Washington, D.C. -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment.\r\n\r\nWhen Proposition 8 passed in California, white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent. At protest rallies that followed, some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants. Not to split hairs, but for most blacks, the n-word trumps the f-word.\r\n\r\nSo while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television, blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry. They see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets. And then there is the history.\r\n\r\nThe 40th anniversary of Stonewall dominated Gay Pride celebrations around the country, and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized, 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood-soaked years black people have been through in this country. There are stories some blacks lived through, stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told.\r\n\r\nWhile those who were at Stonewall talk about the fear of being arrested by police, 40 years ago, blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated. The 13th Amendment was signed in 1865, and it wasn't until 1948 that President Harry S Truman desegregated the military. That's more than an 80-year gap.\r\n\r\nNot to be flip, but Miley Cyrus is older than Bill Clinton's \"don't ask, don't tell", "982": "Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood.

Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest.

And we met at the airport, and we said, \"Oh, let's get together, with the kids.\" And it was one of those wonderful days. We laughed and talked and had lunch, and the kids were jumping off the boat and we were drinking wine. She was just amazing and darling.\r\n\r\nKing: Have you seen her work on Broadway?\r\n\r\nRivers: I've seen her work. I love actresses who go back and forth. I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in \"The Philadelphia Story\" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that.\r\n\r\nKing: What was your read on them as a couple that day?\r\n\r\nRivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That's what kills me. I mean [it] just shouldn't have happened. ... And they made such a good-looking couple, too. He doted on what she said, she doted on -- it was just perfect.\r\n\r\nKing: How did you learn of this yesterday?\r\n\r\nRivers: One of our mutual friends called me and said, do you know about -- I just saw them recently in the thing that Prince Charles gave in England, and a mutual friend said, did you heard about what happened to Natasha?

Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs.\r\n\r\nOnly five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution.\r\n\r\nSome of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms.

We were going do so much after the war ... but it never happened.\"\r\n\r\nTuckwell, who saw action with the 1st Battalion, Dorset Regiment, has since formed a close friendship with Frank Rosier; they are members of the Normandy Veterans Association.\r\n\r\nBoth men say their experiences were so commonplace among their generation that none were able to talk about it until 40 years later.\r\n\r\nRosier told me that what he and the veterans discuss among themselves is very different to what is said in television interviews; but when pushed, he describes what it's like to kill another man.\r\n\r\n\"We could never get our fathers to talk about the first World War, because they were involved in close combat. And twice in the second World War it happened to me.\r\n\r\n\"I came face to face with a German, and I beat him to the draw. I killed him. I sat on the grass and was sick and I cried ... he was some mother's son.\"\r\n\r\nI get the sense that there was a great deal of respect between these soldiers and the Germans on the other side.\r\n\r\nYounger generations try to relate to the scale and the carnage of D-Day through movies like \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\r\n\r\nThe veterans talk of the noise, \"big battleships firing, rocket ships firing, mortars landing, planes strafing, floating artillery and the Germans were totally unsociable about it, they were firing back at us, so there was a hell of a lot of noise there,\" recalls Rosier.\r\n\r\nThey are lighthearted at times, citing the fact that British troops are renowned for their humor -- even in the darkest hours. But it is impossible to gloss over the horror and the danger they faced.\r\n\r\nStanding together in one of the landing crafts at the D-Day museum in Portsmouth, England, Rosier described what it was like to approach Gold beach.

Military commanders urged him to fight the release of the photos, fearing it would endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe photographs first appeared in a report on \"60 Minutes 2\" in late April 2004, followed by an extensive story on the abuse by award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker.\r\n\r\n\"It was a big shock,\" said Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, the head of the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television station. \"It hurt mostly the ones who were for the fall of the Saddam [Hussein] regime. ... It was a heated debate in the Middle East at the time -- whether [the invasion] was the right decision and whether the Americans had bad intentions or not.\" iReport.com: Did Obama make the right call on photos last week?\r\n\r\nThe fallout was immediate, both overseas and at home. A year into the Iraq war, the American public had grown increasingly uneasy about the direction of the war, and the Abu Ghraib photographs gave anti-war protesters the ammunition they needed to rally around their cause and question Bush administration policies.  See Bush administration interrogation tactics \u00bb\r\n\r\nA CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll immediately after the photos were released showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans said the mistreatment of the detainees was unjustified under any circumstances. Bush's overall performance rating sank to what was then the lowest of his presidency, 46 percent. The poll also showed support for the war at its lowest since before it began, with only 44 percent saying they believed it was worthwhile.  See some of the disturbing photos (discretion advised) \u00bb\r\n\r\nIt was a blow from which the administration, especially then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, never fully recovered. Amanpour said Obama's presidential victory and big wins by Democrats in the House and Senate were proof of that.\r\n\r\n\"The American people said that they wanted their good name, the name of their country, the influence and credibility of their country's standing, to be restored in the rest of the world,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe photos did what a print report could not do. They showed front-and-center what human rights groups had been saying for months: that the Bush administration was abusing prisoners within U.S. custody. Some photos showed naked prisoners piled on top of each other like a pyramid. Another showed a smiling female U.S. soldier giving a thumbs-up next to a naked, hooded prisoner.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the furor unleashed by the pictures, 11 American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses, and some officers were reprimanded.\r\n\r\nAl-Rashed said he had expected violations in war, but nothing like \"humiliating individuals in those kinds of scenes.\" The Middle East has a \"bloody, long, bad record about torture of prisoners,\" he said, but what happened at Abu Ghraib was even more reprehensible because it undercut America's democratic values.\r\n\r\n\"You talk about democracy, you talk about the respect of individuality, the freedom. ... The prison pictures just really made us speechless.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was something completely new -- something that we had not seen before in all the dictionary of prisoners and torture and mistreatment. It just weakened the argument completely about the wisdom of getting rid of a regime like Saddam. It made the argument for the other side stronger.\"\r\n\r\nThe photographs had a direct impact within the Iraq insurgency. Just days after the photos became public, American contractor Nicholas Berg was beheaded -- with his executioners saying they were retaliating for Abu Ghraib abuses. The insurgents posted video of the killing on the Internet for all to see.\r\n\r\n\"The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals,\" Obama said. \"In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion, and to put our troops in greater danger.\"  Watch Obama explain reversing course \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe court had ordered the release in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.

I could oversee a show and a magazine that tell people how to live their best lives, but I definitely wasn't setting an example. I was talking the talk, but I wasn't walking the walk. And that was very disappointing to me.\r\n\r\nImmediately after that conversation with Bob, I called my doctor. \"All this medicine is making my life feel like a flat line,\" I said. So my doctor slowly weaned me off it, except for one aspirin a day.

The 9-year-olds probably do, right?\r\n\r\nKate Gosselin: They understand the process. They're working through it, the same that Jon and I are. They're doing remarkably well. This has opened up a lot of discussions between them and myself. A lot of questions come my way, and we're dealing with it. They're doing very well considering.  Watch Gosselin discuss the split \u00bb\r\n\r\nKing: Why did you agree to do this reality show in the first place?\r\n\r\nGosselin: In the very beginning, we started filming a one-hour special. It was a way to document what was happening in our lives. At that time, there was a lot of local news stories. There were a lot of people in the country and the world, believe it or not, pulling for us. As you know, sextuplets are not born every day, so there was a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nWe did the one-hour special to show everyone. I always pictured like the little old lady that was sitting at home who was praying for us, rooting for us and needing to know what happened to those babies that were born. So we did it for that reason as well as to collect the memories for ourselves.\r\n\r\nKing: Why did you agree to do a regular reality show? You could have said that's the special, here's my life, goodbye.\r\n\r\nGosselin: I could have. At that point, the one-hour special was a very good experience. The network, TLC, we were on Discovery Health at that time. Now, TLC is wonderful, supportive, and it was a great experience for us. So we, you know, really moved forward because of that reason. It was healthy and safe and fun.\r\n\r\nKing: Do the kids talk to you about divorce?\r\n\r\nGosselin: They do. And as any child, you know, when their parents are divorcing, the goal is peace and we've achieved that numerous times. The Fourth of July we spent together as a family. My goal is, no matter what the circumstance, no matter what place, you know, one of us is in, my goal is really peace and the best that it can be for the kids.\r\n\r\nKing: Do they get counseling?\r\n\r\nGosselin: We have not started that process, but I feel like it is a very normal thing to do. And absolutely, when the time is right.\r\n\r\nKing: Jon is quoted in the new \"Us Weekly\": \"I wish I had a 9 to 5 job instead of the nightmare I'm living. This is 24/7. I don't even want to do taping the show anymore.\" What's your reaction to that?\r\n\r\nGosselin: Jon's opinions and his goals are his. I know that, personally, for myself and the kids, this has been a good experience. It continues to be a good experience. And, you know, really the network has been extremely supportive, above and beyond, I feel, what they need to be. And I only experience good things.\r\n\r\nEveryone works. Everyone has a job. Everyone has what they're dealing with. And, generally speaking, this is the most flexible, workable, wonderful job for myself.\r\n\r\nKing: How long have you been doing it now?\r\n\r\nGosselin: We are in season 5. We started filming in August of 2005.\r\n\r\nKing: Why is it such a good thing to have a private life public?\r\n\r\nGosselin: It's been a source of huge -- for whatever reason -- inspiration for a lot of people. Many, many people -- many parents feel that their decisions are, maybe not, great decisions. Every parent has that, you know, parent guilt of my goal is to produce wonderful, productive individuals and put them out into society. That is the goal of a parent -- for us to show the world that we are not perfect, life is unpredictable, but life always goes on and there's always, always, always something to look forward to. And for me, that is raising my children to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nKing: But as an intelligent person, you also know to all good things, there are downsides.\r\n\r\nGosselin: Absolutely. With every positive, there is a negative across the board in life. It's about choosing to see the positive and working with the negative.\r\n\r\nKing: So what happens now? Are you and the kids going to do the show and Jon is out?\r\n\r\nGosselin: I'm not the person to make that decision.

However, in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe murky story began in June of this year, when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena, Italy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren's chief designer Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan's wife, Trudy Coughlan, had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren's Woking headquarters. An employee of the copy shop, suspicious that confidential data was being copied, blew the whistle to Ferrari.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney, a friend and former colleague of Coughlan's (the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s). Stepney had been the team's chief mechanic, but in February took his new role as the team's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena, Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari issued the following press statement:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal, concerning the theft of technical information. Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut now the FIA is in possession of new evidence. Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso. On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa, Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated: \"The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession", "1691": "Clinton", "1692": "millions", "1693": "last week", "1694": "Nebraska", "1695": "Colonel Mustapha Nooh", "1696": "twice", "1697": "Thai resort town on Tuesday to try to identify their loved ones' remains.\n\nA Buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of One-Two-Go airline's MD-82 jet at Phuket airport on Tuesday.\n\nMost of those killed were foreign nationals, and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified, according to Thailand's state-run Thai News Agency (TNA).\n\nAll of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals, it reported.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said that five Americans were among those killed when the One-Two-Go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at Phuket's airport on Sunday.\n\nU.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived.\n\nEight British nationals are believed to have died, according to Foreign Secretary David Miliband.

In describing his turn from social activist to environmentalist, Jones recounted his experiences with young people in Oakland, California.\r\n\r\n\"I got involved in this work because I got tired of going to funerals. I got tired of seeing young people without any hope,\" Jones told CNN. \"I wanted them to have a better future. I said, 'Why don't we get these young people trained in green jobs so they can be a part of all these companies that are getting started?' \"\r\n\r\nSo Jones, a Yale Law School graduate and longtime community activist, started an organization called \"Green For All\" in Oakland. The mission was to figure out how to train underprivileged young people in green-jobs skills, such as installing solar panels and retrofitting houses to make them more energy efficient.  Watch more on Van Jones' career \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"People talk about global warming. ... I want to cool the Earth down. I also want to calm the block down,\" said Jones.\r\n\r\nJones' efforts earned him national recognition and grabbed the attention of Obama's advisers.\r\n\r\nNow, he is the president's pitchman for green jobs, helping to coordinate government agencies focused on delivering millions of green jobs to the ailing U.S. economy.\r\n\r\n\"I see myself as the green-jobs handyman. My job is to make sure that the president's desire that we have literally millions of green jobs in our country actually turns into reality,\" said Jones.\r\n\r\nYet even in places like Michigan, where unemployment is a whopping 15 percent -- well above the national average of 9.5 percent -- Jones understands there's skepticism about his message.\r\n\r\nCNN followed Jones on a recent visit to Lansing, Michigan, where he told attendees at a green-jobs conference that saving the planet and saving jobs can go hand in hand.\r\n\r\n\"You say, 'Oh no, oh no -- you're gonna talk about the caulking gun. Oh no!' \" Jones joked with the crowd.\r\n\r\nCritics, though, have serious concerns about the \"green collar\" agenda. They argue that those green jobs -- retrofitting homes to make them more energy-efficient, for instance -- will be mostly low-level and low-paying.\r\n\r\nJones dismisses that.\r\n\r\n\"You take somebody and maybe this summer they're putting up solar panels,\" Jones said. \"Well guess what, this is a growing part of our economy -- the next summer they can be a manager, the next summer, maybe they can be an owner, an investor, an inventor.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Jones tries to spread his green message, he's also trying to practice what he preaches. That means taking public transportation, including a bus and train ride, to get to his office just across the street from the White House. He says those rides give him valuable opportunities to hear unvarnished views.\r\n\r\nDescribing his work as a member of the executive branch, Jones said, \"Everybody that comes talk to us, they've already got an agenda, they've got their game face on. [On] public transportation, people are themselves.\"\r\n\r\nAs for who Jones is, he gave CNN a brief look at his new office at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. On the walls hang pictures of his heroes, each Jones described with a different strength. Basketball legend Michael Jordan: dedication and commitment. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali: fighting spirit.\r\n\r\nFinally, pointing to a picture above his desk, Jones' tone grew softer.\r\n\r\n\"This is Bobby Kennedy the day before he was killed.

Ray Odierno, issued a joint statement expressing sadness over al-Hakim's death and describing him as \"a national leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,\" the statement said. \"We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.\"  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future \u00bb\r\n\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered his condolences, saying al-Hakim was \"like an old brother.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Maliki credited him for being a \"strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq.\"\r\n\r\n\"His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,\" al-Maliki said in the statement.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim ended his more than 20-year exile in Iran in 2003, when he returned to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his regime.\r\n\r\n\"It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,\" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. \"I was longing to see them. My goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them.\"\r\n\r\nIraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return.\r\n\r\nDuring his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHe took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south.\r\n\r\nSCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word \"revolution,\" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man.\r\n\r\nHis political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did.\r\n\r\nGovernment ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad.\r\n\r\nAnd when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence in Iraq, saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government, which raised concerns about what it called Iran's \"meddling.\" He cited the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries' shared border, historical and cultural relations, and emphasized the desire for strong ties.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim's death comes at a time of violent political turmoil in Iraq. The power of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq party he leaves behind is just as uncertain as the nation he so proudly wanted to serve.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007, and was first treated in the United States, then later in Iran.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Iraq later that year, he told CNN that he felt good.

It's also about the same amount of radiation as other standard cardiac screenings, such as the nuclear stress test.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide range of exposures in the study depending on the medical center and the way the tests were performed. The median radiation dose ranged from 4.6 to 30 mSv. About 80 percent of the centers studied used techniques to reduce radiation, such as adjusting the CT scan to the patient's size (meaning smaller patients get less radiation) or precisely timing the radiation dose to a particular point in the heart rhythm (which shortens the duration of exposure). Health.com: How to help your heart for better health\r\n\r\nOverall, the danger posed by radiation is very small, according to Hausleiter. Being exposed to 10 mSv increases an individual's cancer risk by 0.02 percent, he says. However, the greater the exposure to radiation, the greater the risk.  Watch Dr. Gupta talk about the cardiac CT scan \u00bb\r\n\r\nNearly all of the 50 sites in the international study, which included sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, were making at least some effort to limit excess radiation. Other medical centers may be doing even less to cut down on radiation during the test, says Andrew J. Einstein, M.D., Ph.D., of Columbia University Medical Center, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\r\n\r\n\"Probably the group of centers which were studied in this paper are more sophisticated and more aware of radiation-reduction methods than your typical center that is performing cardiac CT angiography,\" he says. According to Einstein, many other sites may not be using radiation-reduction techniques at all.\r\n\r\nWhen cardiac CT angiography is being used appropriately -- meaning, for example, in people with chest pain suggesting blocked heart arteries, rather than as a screening test for people with no symptoms of heart disease -- the benefits far outweigh the risk of the radiation, according to Einstein and Hausleiter.\r\n\r\nHowever, cardiac CT scans are often marketed directly to patients interested in finding out how much plaque they have in their arteries, even though there's no evidence to show that this is an appropriate way to use the test, Hausleiter says. Health.com: 28 days, 28 ways to slash your risk of heart disease\r\n\r\nCritics of cardiac CT angiography question whether its benefits warrant its current widespread use and the amount of radiation exposure. In fact, on Monday the American Heart Association issued an advisory warning that imaging tests, including CT scans, be used cautiously to minimize exposure to radiation.\r\n\r\nIn the new study, Hausleiter and his colleagues looked at patients who underwent cardiac CT angiography at 21 university hospitals and 29 community hospitals between February and December 2007. They found some regional differences in radiation exposure; for example, the median dose was three times higher in South America and Latin America than in Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\nMore than 70 percent of the centers in the study were using electrocardiographically controlled tube current modulation (ECTCM), which is currently the best-known strategy for reducing radiation dose. It involves timing the radiation beam to the diastole, when the heart is resting between beats. This is when the heart is the quietest, so it's easiest to get a good image of the organ.

Finally, sequential scans take a series of pictures of the heart at the same exact point in the cardiac cycle, which also reduces radiation dose. This approach, as well as ECTCM, can be used only in people with slow, steady heartbeats. Another problem, Einstein noted, is that doctors often don't know what a patient's heart rate will be until he or she is on the table being readied for the scan.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that centers were able to use at least one radiation-reduction technique in most patients \"should serve as a wake-up call to cardiac CT laboratories that do not routinely use these methods,\" Einstein writes in his editorial.

They are versions of our best selves: the doers in life, the fearless, those who go over the mountain and come back to tell us what's on the other side.\r\n\r\nWhile we may think the true adventurers are a species apart, we are all adventurers at heart -- yet sometimes the urge is stifled by modern life.\r\n\r\nThe lust for adventure is planted in childhood. How many of us sat enthralled under the blankets as our parents read us the adventures of the Famous Five, \"Treasure Island,\" \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" \"The Swiss Family Robinson,\" \"Tarzan\" and \"Peter Pan\"?\r\n\r\nChildren weaned on such stories may be forgiven for assuming adulthood is one long adventure that swings wildly between jungles, swamps, deserted islands and alpine heights.\r\n\r\nYet modern life is increasingly sedentary and safety-conscious. The desire for comfort and convenience ameliorates our contradictory urge to explore.\r\n\r\nA few have it thrust upon them: stranded in an inhospitable place, lost in a jungle or called up for combat -- and they find themselves dropped in an adventure that they may not have chosen; but for the main part, adventure comes to those who seek it.\r\n\r\nDr. James Thompson, a senior lecturer in psychology at University College London, says seeking adventure is more common \"amongst people who are extroverted, who are outgoing, who are sociable, because one of the things they need -- apart from the excitement of people -- is excitement generally.\"\r\n\r\nBut if you think adventure is something that only happens to other people; that you are too unfit to climb a mountain, too scared to sail across the open sea, too nervous to travel through a country where you can't speak the language; perhaps you should rethink. After all, having an adventure could be good for you.\r\n\r\nPsychologists have linked adventure-seeking with a range of positive qualities. Adventure can:\r\n\r\nFollowing the stories of this age's greatest adventurers such as polar explorer Douglas Mawson, Everest climber Edmund Hillary and mountaineer Reinhold Messner, we are encouraged not just to follow their paths up mountains or along rock faces -- they also inspire us to take more risks, to seize more from each day.\r\n\r\nWho could fail to be inspired after watching CNN interview the world's greatest living mountaineer, Reinhold Messner?\r\n\r\nIn 1980, Messner was the first person to ascend Mount Everest alone without supplementary oxygen.\r\n\r\nLater, he crossed Antarctica on skis.\r\n\r\nHe tells CNN anchor Becky Anderson: \"I'm a normal person, a totally normal person, and I was really lucky in my life to have to have the opportunity to follow my dreams. So in the beginning I was a rock climber, and all my enthusiasm, my energy and my willpower went into rock climbing.\"\r\n\r\nMany young people are naturally adventurous -- throwing their energy and enthusiasm behind sport, hobbies and travel. Witness the explosion of school leavers taking gap years (a year off in between school and university or the workforce), with the destinations becoming more and more exotic and activities accompanying the travel designed to expand their mind as well as their horizons.\r\n\r\nBut later in life, we can wake up and find our lives leeched of adventure. We may be loaded down with a mortgage, kids or a demanding job.\r\n\r\nAdventure then becomes something we prefer to read about rather than live.\r\n\r\nWe fall into the trap of the armchair traveler and become transfixed by all the journeys we didn't make.\r\n\r\nInstead of setting out on our own expeditions, we read Joe Simpson's account of his near-death mountaineering experiences in \"Touching the Void.\" Or we follow Sebastian Junger's account of wild sea adventures in \"The Perfect Storm", "2087": "more than double", "2088": "The use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines", "2089": "23-year-old", "2090": "adultery", "2091": "Medicare", "2092": "9-year-old girl was laid to rest Wednesday", "2093": "Mauricio Funes", "2094": "former Boy Scout", "2095": "change are varied and complex", "2096": "Sarasota", "2097": "Gaza City", "2098": "74 people in northern India, according to officials.\r\n\r\nMonsoon rain has bought heavy flooding to southern Nepal, pictured, and northern India.\r\n\r\nThe Nepalese army Thursday used helicopters to rescue residents in southeastern Nepal who were stranded on treetops and roofs after monsoon flooding forced more than 50,000 people from their homes.\r\n\r\nIn northern India monsoon flooding destroyed mud huts and killed at least 74", "2099": "southwestern Michigan, officials said.\r\n\r\nFrom left, Lance Battreal, Mark Booher and Charles Smith escaped from an Indiana prison Sunday", "2100": "blocked the search engine's camera car from photographing their homes.\n\nBroughton, can be seen from the air on Google Earth, but not from the ground.\n\nFearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the Web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets, villagers in Broughton, north of London, summoned the police after spotting the car.\n\n\"I was upstairs when I spotted the camera car driving down the lane,\" resident Paul Jacobs told The Times of London.\n\n\"My immediate reaction was anger: How dare anyone take a photograph of my home without my consent", "2101": "Tuesday by the University of Colorado's Board of Regents.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ward Churchill wrote that some 9/11 victims were \"little Eichmanns.\"\r\n\r\nWard Churchill raised hackles with a 2002 essay that argued the September 11, 2001, attacks were a justified reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East, and said the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania had \"the courage of their convictions.\"\r\n\r\nBut the regents said Churchill's firing was unrelated to the essay", "2102": "al Qaeda group", "2103": "100,000", "2104": "Sunni", "2105": "75% off the newsstand price", "2106": "cracking down", "2107": "There's no question that Duprevil was pulled out alive from the rubble of a Port-au-Prince building Tuesday", "2108": "the children's home city of Mumbai", "2109": "1990s", "2110": "10 to 15 thousand", "2111": "a justified reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East, and said the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania had \"the courage of their convictions.\"\r\n\r\nBut the regents said Churchill's firing was unrelated to the essay, which went largely unnoticed for three years.

See photos of Dugard's living conditions \u00bb\r\n\r\nAfter his arrest, Garrido said documents he gave to the FBI would be key, that they would help people understand who he really was. He told a local television reporter the documents would show a \"heartwarming story,\" one that helped him \"completely\" turn his life around. KCRA: Read transcript of Garrido's interview after his arrest\r\n\r\nThe documents provide a glimpse into the mind of a man who said he thinks he has a God-given gift. The power to control minds with sound was his salvation, he said, and would help others before they committed violence.\r\n\r\nHe wrote that he wanted to share his story to provide \"solid hope for everyone who suffers from the many forms of aggressive sexual behavior as well as other problematic behaviors.\"\r\n\r\nGarrido spoke of his sexual urges during his trial in 1977, when he was convicted of abducting and raping a 25-year-old casino worker in a mini-warehouse. He spent 11 years in jail for those crimes. He testified about his sexual fantasies, which included masturbating while reading magazines, watching movies, and in restaurants or bathrooms.\r\n\r\nIn his writings, he detailed how hard it was for him to control himself. Garrido wrote that he realized he couldn't control his impulses and they were plaguing the ones he loved.\r\n\r\n\"Certain behaviors cause a great deal of pain in myself and those who are victimized by those behaviors, especially our family and my wife,\" he wrote.\r\n\r\nThat pain made him try to change from the predator he had become, he wrote.\r\n\r\nHe said he began forcing himself to look at attractive women, but would not allow himself to act.\r\n\r\n\"See how beautiful she is to look at,\" he would tell himself.\r\n\r\nIn time, Garrido wrote, he began to stop physically acting on his feelings.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, Garrido wrote, he kept those sexual compulsions at bay, beginning with controlling masturbation, which he said in the past had often taken place in public.\r\n\r\nHe wrote that he became free and able to experience sexual enjoyment for the first time with his wife, though it was unclear whether he was referring to Nancy, his legal wife, or to Dugard, the mother of two of his children.\r\n\r\nHe claimed he realized how wrong he had been in the past.\r\n\r\n\"I realized I never needed to act or do the things I used to believe was so great and stimulating,\" Garrido wrote, referring to what he called \"one of the most powerful freedoms imaginable", "2402": "New York Post", "2403": "not guilty along with the other defendants", "2404": "First", "2405": "Chen", "2406": "British", "2407": "crop yields", "2408": "Iraqis", "2409": "250 others -- including at least 80", "2410": "the Web site", "2411": "10 to 15 thousand", "2412": "9 a.m.", "2413": "Cook County", "2414": "Preservation's endangered list", "2415": "full horrors of war", "2416": "New York City", "2417": "the Soviets", "2418": "Po Toi O a small fishing village at Clear Water Bay in the New Territories, Hong Kong.

Their charred bodies were left dangling from a bridge over the Euphrates River in spring 2004.\r\n\r\nIn November of that year, U.S. and Iraqi forces attacked insurgents in Falluja, killing about 1,200 militants. Eight Iraqi soldiers and 51 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, died in urban combat, according to the Pentagon.

But if water is added to a chemical heater, a hot meal results.\r\r\n\r\r\nEach pallet was rigged with a large parachute as well as special corrugated cardboard padding that would minimize damage to the water and food when the load hit the ground.\r\r\n\r\r\nOne of the supervisors on the rigging crew at the Army's Fort Bragg, which is adjacent to Pope Air Force Base, said they wanted to make sure as much of the aid, especially the water, survived the airdrop, but they predicted as many as 1-in-10 of the bottles would break on impact. The MREs are much less susceptible to damage during airdrops.

When a computer in the cockpit calculated that the plane was over the drop zone, a signal was given, the pilot pitched the plane upward and the huge straps and gate that held the cargo in place were released. Within seconds, gravity pulled all 40 pallets out of the plane and the parachutes automatically deployed.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn less than a minute the food and water was on the ground, ready to be unpacked and distributed.\r\r\n\r\r\nMaj. Jeff \"Ratdog\" Daniels, the pilot of the C-17, said the U.S. military teams waiting for the airdrop on the ground reported all 40 parachutes opened properly and all the bundles landed on target in the planned drop zone.

It strongly condemns this heinous attack. Whoever else who may have planned, plotted and supported the perpetrators of this terrorist attack will be apprehended and justice will prevail.\"\r\n\r\nMedia reports said Islamic Jihad in Yemen -- which is affiliated with al Qaeda -- has claimed responsibility for the attack, but CNN could not independently confirm those reports.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. State Department said it is sending a team of law enforcement and security experts to help in the investigation, spokesman Sean McCormack said.\r\n\r\nTrev Mason, a British national who lives near the embassy, said he saw \"a massive fireball\" near compound.

It has cited concern \"about possible attacks by extremist individuals or groups against U.S. citizens, facilities, businesses and perceived interests.\"\r\n\r\nThe State Department ordered the departure of all non-emergency American staff from the Embassy, along with their family members, in April, after attacks against the Embassy and a residential compound. That order was lifted last month.\r\n\r\nIn March, three mortar rounds landed near the Embassy, injuring Yemeni students at a nearby school and Yemeni government security personnel, the State Department said.\r\n\r\nThe next month, an expatriate residential compound in the Hadda neighborhood was attacked by mortar fire.

About half of them wore shiny wedding bands.\r\n\r\nAll had tried to buy a prostitute's services and were caught by police. It was their first offense, and a county court referred them to a one-day program called the John School. It's a program run by volunteers and city officials in conjunction with Magdalene House, a nonprofit that works to get prostitutes off the streets.\r\n\r\n\"Prostitution doesn't discriminate,\" said Kenny Baker, a cognitive behavioral therapist who is the program's director. \"Most of these men don't have a prior criminal history, so our goal is to help these folks understand why they put themselves in a bad position, to prevent it from happening again.\"\r\n\r\nSet in a church in Nashville, Tennessee, the John School is led by former prostitutes, health experts, psychologists and law enforcement officers who talk to -- and at times berate -- the men about the risks of hiring a prostitute.\r\n\r\nProstitution is based on the law of supply and demand. The thinking is: Women won't stop selling sex until men stop buying.\r\n\r\nSo Nashville and a growing number of cities are shifting their focus from locking up suppliers to educating buyers. Across the country, about 50 communities are using John Schools. Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore, Maryland, are among dozens more cities that plan to launch similar programs by the end of the year.  See where the John Schools are \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"It will make them [offenders] see that this is not a victimless crime, and they are contributing to the exploitation of women,\" said Stephanie Davis, policy adviser on women's issues at the mayor's office in Atlanta. \"It's hurting them, the man, and it's hurting their families and its hurting the community.\"\r\n\r\nNo comprehensive effort has been made to track the numbers, but experts estimate 1 million to 2 million prostitutes work in the United States. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Report lists about 78,000 arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice, but experts say those numbers are extremely conservative because many sex workers and johns aren't caught.\r\n\r\nExperts add that easy accessibility to prostitutes and pornography on the Internet are feeding the problem.\r\n\r\nIn most communities, prostitution has been a one-sided battle focused on the women who offer sex. Their customers, when they are arrested, are usually cited for a misdemeanor and fined.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, prostitutes are often charged with more severe sentences and jailed for months, depending on the offense.\r\n\r\nBut in Nashville, the johns' faces are shown on a police Web site.\r\n\r\nFor decades, Nashville battled prostitution by arresting women on the streets and through stings. Still, the problem persisted, irritating business owners and residents.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1990s, Nashville's mayor helped launch the John School with the help of the Magdalene House, public defenders, prosecutors and police officers. Nashville became one of the first major cities in the U.S. to focus on the customers, predominantly men.\r\n\r\nOnly first-time offenders who solicit an adult are eligible for John School. Johns who pick up minors are not eligible and face much tougher sentences.\r\n\r\n\"If you get caught again and you get me, I will guarantee to put you in jail,\" warned Antoinette Welch, a local prosecutor, in speaking to the men in the class. \"I've had men cry to me that they will lose their jobs or their wives, but you're all grown up and you make your own decisions.\"\r\n\r\nThe men listened carefully as Welch talked about their records; many had not yet told their wives or significant others about their arrest.\r\n\r\nIf the john pleads guilty, pays a $250 fee and completes the course without re-offending, the charge can be dismissed after a year. The money paid by the john goes to Magdalene House; the program doesn't cost taxpayers any money. John School models in other communities may differ.\r\n\r\nA woman who called herself Alexis, a 35-year-old former prostitute with dark hair and bright blue eyes, spoke to the men as the class came to an end. Four years ago, she left the streets and now works at a factory.\r\n\r\nBy the age of 10, Alexis had learned to barter with sex with her stepfather. In her 20s, she found herself hooked on drugs and selling her body. She was arrested more than 80 times. She was hospitalized after someone shot her on the job.\r\n\r\nAs she told her story, the men were silent. A few blushed, while others stared at the floor.\r\n\r\n\"These gentlemen are no different than I was on the streets,\" she said. \"I think everyone has to look at the void they are trying to fill.\"\r\n\r\nOne john, a father of two with salt-and-pepper hair, found himself near tears after Alexis spoke. In July, he tried to pick up a prostitute through Craigslist. He said he was depressed and having problems with his wife.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so embarrassed,\" he said. \"These girls are somebody's daughters. I have a daughter.\"\r\n\r\nSome evidence suggests that John Schools are working. A study released in 2008 by Abt Associates Inc. for the federal government looked at the John School program in San Francisco, California. It's one of the largest programs in the country; more than 7,000 johns have attended since 1995.\r\n\r\nAccording to the study, the re-arrest rate fell sharply after the school was launched, and stayed more than 30 percent lower for 10 years afterward.\r\n\r\nBut critics call John School a slap on the wrist. On Saturday, one john abandoned the classroom.\r\n\r\nCarol Leigh, a member of the Sex Workers Outreach Project, a group that promotes decriminalizing prostitution in California, said she doesn't believe the program is an effective deterrent.\r\n\r\n\"John School doesn't do that much,\" said Leigh, who has worked as a prostitute. \"The reality is they aren't spending that much time on the johns and they will just go to other venues. This also doesn't target the violent offenders who are the real problem.\"\r\n\r\nMelissa Farley, head of the nonprofit group Prostitution Research and Education in San Fransisco, believes johns deserve stronger punishment like longer prison sentences.\r\n\r\nA recent study by the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation conducted among johns in Chicago, Illinois, found that 41 percent of them said John School", "2696": "Fabian Cancellara", "2697": "finances.\r\n\r\n\"Our operations are strong and during this process Polaroid will ship products to our retail partners, work with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to fulfill retailer demand ...\" said Mary L.

Proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken-and-egg dilemma over whether to build million-dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use.\r\n\r\nEnergy companies are reluctant to pour money into expensive fueling stations without a lot of hydrogen vehicles around, but consumers are not likely to buy a vehicle without adequate places to fill up.\r\n\r\n\"It is clear nothing is going to displace gasoline or diesel for 20, 30, maybe 40 years,\" said John Lapetz, who has been working on alternative fuels at Ford for more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nThe Orlando project has several goals: To get average consumers acquainted with hydrogen and to acquire data on the buses' performance in a setting where they are in use almost nonstop.\r\n\r\nLapetz said it's an effort to use a technology that customers take for granted (the internal combustion engine), while preparing for the day when drivers can complete the divorce from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nAt the Boggy Creek Hydrogen Fueling Station in Orlando, the hydrogen is produced on-site. \"We are doing a process called steam methane re-forming, which is natural gas to hydrogen,\" said Puneet Verma, manager of biofuels and hydrogen at Chevron Technology Ventures, one of the players involved in the project.\r\n\r\nDuring a careful fueling process, technicians check for leaks of the highly flammable hydrogen -- leaks both in the bus and the fuel pump.\r\n\r\nBecause a fossil fuel, methane, is used to make the hydrogen, the buses are about 12 percent cleaner than gasoline or diesel when their entire carbon footprint is measured.\r\n\r\n\"We view the hydrogen efforts as a technical success,\" said Verma. \"This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate actual production of hydrogen at the station. It's not necessarily an economic success yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ultimate goal is hydrogen fuel cell cars,\" Verma said. \"The hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive to manufacture", "2829": "Simon Cowell", "2830": "first", "2831": "more than 24", "2832": "Monday", "2833": "two of Shell's pipelines early Monday.\r\n\r\nAfter a helicopter flyover of the area, Shell confirmed that parts of its large Nembe Creek \"trunk line\" were damaged", "2834": "Pakistani", "2835": "first", "2836": "one count of \"prescribing, administering or dispensing a controlled substance to an addict", "2837": "World welterweight champion Pacquiao", "2838": "Johannesburg's international airport", "2839": "Pakistani", "2840": "al Qaeda was released Friday on provisional liberty, but must report daily to police, a National Court spokeswoman told CNN", "2841": "Israeli", "2842": "setting two fires Friday night", "2843": "1992", "2844": "Monsoon flooding has left 50,000 people homeless in Nepal", "2845": "three", "2846": "Paulson", "2847": "having schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder", "2848": "Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the court's chief prosecutor, using the French", "2849": "Sunday night", "2850": "A family spokesman on Saturday said", "2851": "Monday", "2852": "Two human-rights activists were shot and killed in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Thursday evening, leading a U.N. investigator to call for an independent investigation to prove that Kenyan police were not involved.\r\n\r\nU.N. invesitgator Phillip Alston said an inquiry into the activists deaths was the only way to eliminate suspicions of police involvement.\r\n\r\nThe shootings spurred a protest by students that led police to fatally shoot a student, police said.

[D]ropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American.\"\r\n\r\nThe president's commitment to education is truly remarkable, considering the enormous array of policy challenges confronting the administration. From health care and the economic crisis, to global warming and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration is beset by controversies that will not be easily resolved.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the president and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, have not allowed education to be ignored or placed on the back burner says a great deal about their recognition of its central importance to our nation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the administration navigates its way into the policy debates that are swirling over the future of education, it would be wise for it to proceed with caution.\r\n\r\nThe administration has already staked out positions on a number of issues -- charter schools and merit pay for teachers being two of the big ones -- which run the risk of generating additional controversy in the polarized debates over how to reform education.\r\n\r\nIf these issues and the stimulus money being made available under the Race to the Top (RTT) program are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue. The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers.\r\n\r\nThe current policy debates over the direction of education are typically presented as battles between the reformers, led by school superintendents like Joel Klein of New York and Michelle Rhee of Washington, D.C., and the defenders of the status quo, most often presented as the powerful teacher unions and other elements of the education establishment.\r\n\r\nWhile anyone familiar with the current debates knows that the differences between the two sides are real and profound, a protracted battle over the direction of education reform is not a good thing either for the administration or for those who genuinely want to see improvement in public education.\r\n\r\nInstead of choosing sides, it would be wise for the administration to do all it can to find common ground between the opposing camps as it formulates new policy initiatives.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of requiring states to adopt some form of merit pay for teachers -- a measure to which both the teachers' unions, the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have already declared their opposition -- the administration could encourage states to adopt school-based formulas that reward increases in student achievement.\r\n\r\nThis is similar, though not identical, to the approach taken in New York City, one that encourages collaboration among teachers and recognizes the importance of evidence that children are learning.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, rather than touting charter schools as the solution to public education, the administration should treat the best charters as models of innovation that provide educators with the flexibility to implement new strategies. This is a subtle but important distinction that has been lacking in many of the administration's pronouncements about charter schools.\r\n\r\nUnlike the public schools, many charter schools find ways to avoid serving the most disadvantaged students, and their teachers often work a longer day and longer school year without a contract.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of the best charters are subsidized by private philanthropists and are able to spend considerably more per pupil than traditional public schools. These facts should not be used to negate the accomplishments of the excellent charter schools that have emerged in many large cities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is far more likely that struggling public schools in these same cities would be more open to learning from the charters' accomplishments if they were not cast as competitors.\r\n\r\nFinally, the president has championed the idea of \"promise neighborhoods\" as a way to increase the availability of social services to children in high poverty communities, using as a model the Harlem Childrens Zone.\r\n\r\nIf this initiative is to result in lasting benefits to children, it will need to be combined with creative approaches to reforming urban public schools that re-formulate how we think about standards and focus attention more intently on how to deliver quality instruction to children.\r\n\r\nWith dropout rates at over 50 percent in several of our nation's cities, the administration must realize that tinkering at the margins with No Child Left Behind will not deliver the change we need.\r\n\r\nThe president entered office promising to bring a new kind of politics to the nation, an approach that focused on finding common ground among diverse constituencies to solve the pressing problems of our time. In areas like health care, energy, the economy and foreign policy, this new approach has not yet gained traction.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not too late for the president to unite the nation around a common effort to improve public education. For this to happen, he will need to keep above the fray and stay focused on a strategy that sends a clear message to all constituencies that working together to improve public education is in our national interest.\r\n\r\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary", "3043": "The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front", "3044": "less-heralded", "3045": "Michael Shannon", "3046": "threats", "3047": "Roman Abramovich", "3048": "Dr. Goodall", "3049": "poor record", "3050": "Just days before he was arrested and an 18-year-old kidnap mystery", "3051": "Nancy, his legal wife, or to Dugard", "3052": "2015", "3053": "City-County Council member and state senator", "3054": "early Monday", "3055": "The toll was the result of clashes that broke out between demonstrators and security forces", "3056": "1997", "3057": "Los Angeles, California", "3058": "2005", "3059": "Heavy rains and flooding", "3060": "Virginia Commonwealth University student, went missing days after arriving in New York City to celebrate New Year's Eve", "3061": "D-Indiana", "3062": "EBT card or food stamps", "3063": "Leona Helmsley", "3064": "The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe", "3065": "Robert Reich", "3066": "August 1977", "3067": "2007", "3068": "gallon ...

The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade", "3084": "the current cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has a high fatality rate because sufferers are either not able to reach health centers in time or that the health centers lack the capacity to treat the cases.\r\n\r\n\"The epidemic is clearly on the increase", "3085": "lions, tigers, leopards and grizzly bears", "3086": "December 28", "3087": "above 60 percent", "3088": "Chester Arthur Stiles", "3089": "Philippine", "3090": "the prefix \"Mc\" in McCurry", "3091": "Spain", "3092": "American Morning blog", "3093": "nine", "3094": "74 and 75 as Napoli moved up to ninth in the table.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine also provided the cross that Udinese defender Cristian Zapata put into his own net to leave the visitors playing catch-up from just the third minute.\r\n\r\nPepe leveled the score on nine minutes", "3095": "his outspokenness", "3096": "the numbers", "3097": "Eyup Erdem", "3098": "Blackwater", "3099": "expel the Iranians from a camp on Iraqi", "3100": "Wednesday to raping and murdering Chelsea King, was involved in Amber's disappearance.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We have been working closely with San Diego Sheriff's Office, and our investigators are working with theirs in case there is a connection,\" Lt.

By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels", "3265": "Jose Mourinho", "3266": "The Liberty Sun", "3267": "marble", "3268": "Nobel speech", "3269": "Pennsylvania", "3270": "The game's storyline follows the path of \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" the T.E. Lawrence book that inspired the epic movie \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" Amy Henning, the writer for the \"Uncharted\" series, pulls elements from Lawrence's book and weaves them into a stunning narrative about Nathan's search for a lost city called Iram of the Pillars.\r\r\n\r\r\nKeith Guerrette, lead visual effects artist from Naughty Dog, said Henning really opened up the characters in the game and delves deeply into Nathan's past as well as his connections to his companions. While some of the story is told in flashbacks, it never feels disjointed or out of place and flows with the action in the game.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe pace, for the most part, is quick and occurs over several different types of environments. From a vast desert to historical chateaus, the scenes are beautifully rendered and help deepen the moment. There were a couple of missions that bogged down the story in places, but those were few and far between.\r\r\n\r\r\nMany times, I felt like I was in an \"Indiana Jones\" movie. There were moments when the gameplay was very similar to what I've seen on the big screen. For example, one mission had me chasing after a caravan transporting my longtime friend, Victor Sullivan, through a narrow cavern in a scene that was reminiscent of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nLike Dr. Jones, Nathan has to solve puzzles and use his journal to reference solutions. The puzzles were not extremely challenging once the clues in the journal were deciphered. There are other little touches that are Jones-esque, but they add to the story rather than taking away from it. The action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe dialogue helps keep the mood light as character banter flows naturally and feels like what it is -- conversations between people who don't take themselves too seriously but have experienced life-changing events. There is humor, caring, concern and sarcasm that one would expect from longtime friends. It feels natural and gets the player emotionally involved.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We've been building up to this one,\" Guerrette said. \"We went in thinking, 'How can we take our tech and art and make them even better?' \"\r\r\n\r\r\nThere are subtle effects in the environment, like shadows from a fire, ripples in water and disappearing footprints in sand. But the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which Nathan takes on his enemies while the background moves.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuch of Nathan's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings, like the \"Assassin's Creed\" games. That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe game's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times. Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles. Melee was improved (I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory.\r\r\n\r\r\nStealth has become a more effective tool in some missions. There was one mission, however, where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill. It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance.\r\r\n\r\r\nTargeting specific areas on enemies also didn't seem to matter. There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down. Yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy's arm to get him to collapse.\r\r\n\r\r\nNathan can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way. The audio is funny, but the effects are devastating.\r\r\n\r\r\nA split-screen co-op version (a fan request) offers a unique story with the chance to unlock multiplayer bonuses and skills. This version can be played either on or offline.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe multiplayer version also features improved cinematic techniques, boosters and the ability to upload great (or not-so-great) gameplay moments into social media platforms. A buddy system can be used for cooperative play in multiplayer mode, or you can go it alone during competitive play.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Uncharted 3\" is an outstanding adventure game that gives you a feature-film feeling. The environments are open and interactive. The story is unique and fresh. And the characters are portrayed in ways that make them feel real and emotional.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile developers wouldn't say if this was the final act for Nathan Drake, there are moments", "3271": "James Callaghan", "3272": "23", "3273": "2009", "3274": "Tower Records", "3275": "Huntelaar", "3276": "IQ", "3277": "first time", "3278": "anthems", "3279": "Stuttgart", "3280": "the midterm elections near", "3281": "images of their houses or cars being included in the product", "3282": "Calderon's government", "3283": "Republican", "3284": "4 a.m.", "3285": "worms", "3286": "Comcast", "3287": "U.S.-Mexico", "3288": "deniers", "3289": "Roden", "3290": "gay", "3291": "Roland Martin", "3292": "Music, TV and film", "3293": "messages", "3294": "Tuesday", "3295": "18", "3296": "The investigation into what", "3297": "kids' show host Cerrie Burnell", "3298": "Shiv Kapur", "3299": "file murder charges", "3300": "a number of embarrassing problems", "3301": "the excavation team", "3302": "1963 March", "3303": "Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.\r\n\r\nHiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.\r\n\r\nIt's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.\r\n\r\nThis director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance.\r\n\r\nApparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked \"You get what you pay for, folks\" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end.\r\n\r\nThat unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more.\r\n\r\nBeautifully shot by Anthony Dod", "3304": "Abdulrahman al-Lahim, had his license revoked last week", "3305": "there is no nuclear material", "3306": "Paris", "3307": "Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday blamed supporters of the Dalai Lama for recent violence in Tibet, and said Chinese", "3308": "25-year-old civil war", "3309": "You Don't Mess With the Zohan", "3310": "North Korea", "3311": "Thursday", "3312": "less than Palestinian sources reported", "3313": "California corrections officials", "3314": "18.00 GMT", "3315": "Suzman", "3316": "no indication of foul play", "3317": "parade of Songs of the Summer", "3318": "Kendra Barkoff", "3319": "Bomb disposal experts", "3320": "Wednesday", "3321": "a positive state of mind", "3322": "Shivraj Patil", "3323": "The U.N.", "3324": "militant Haqqani network", "3325": "half-mile", "3326": "United Airlines Flight 93", "3327": "Poland to the United States", "3328": "Dragonball", "3329": "Petters Group Worldwide", "3330": "The explosives", "3331": "Democratic Congress", "3332": "Kate Simonson", "3333": "the birth of their oldest daughter, Megan, \"probably saved our lives, because she was born a year after Adam [died], when we were spiraling into hell.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps to save themselves, they made it their mission to preserve Adam's legacy by helping other crime victims.\r\n\r\nThe abduction and murder", "3334": "Japan", "3335": "The Federal Aviation Administration", "3336": "Telluride", "3337": "the \u00c2\u00a32 million ($3 million) horse", "3338": "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office", "3339": "Chandeleur", "3340": "4 a.m.", "3341": "there was the red carpet and an interview with E! host Ryan Seacrest, where they grinned and repeated their disbelief", "3342": "his family and friends", "3343": "43,000", "3344": "1992", "3345": "senior", "3346": "ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Soft music filled the room as waiters served white wine and hors d'oeuvres", "3347": "Holocaust deniers", "3348": "1-0", "3349": "Dunkin' Donuts", "3350": "the EEG data with standard psychometric tests", "3351": "Americans", "3352": "It sounds a little kooky when people first", "3353": "Washington's transit system", "3354": "a serious view of his religion", "3355": "ISAF airstrike on a hijacked oil tanker is carried into the Kunduz hospital on Friday.\r\n\r\nCapt.

They returned to the plant about eight and a half hours later, and no fresh damage to the facility had been reported Friday afternoon, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the quake, engineers had been injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the No. 1 reactor containment shell to counter a buildup of hydrogen in the chamber. That process continued while the plant was evacuated, and so did the pumping of fresh water into that reactor and units 2 and 3, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.\r\r\n\r\r\nHydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors, which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami. The nitrogen injections are aimed at displacing oxygen in the reactor shell, reducing the possibility of an explosion -- a chance Tokyo Electric called \"extremely low.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nA hydrogen explosion blew the roof and upper walls off the No 1. reactor building two days after the quake, and another blast two days later blew apart the No. 3 building.

Watch Zeynep Fadilioglu show off her work and inspirations \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe shores of the Bosporus Strait are studded with 16th century masterpieces such as the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by the Ottoman Empire's most famous architect, Mimar Sinan, and ornate, neo-Baroque jewels designed by the Armenian Balyan family in the 19th century. But Istanbul's most senior Muslim cleric laments that mosque design suffered a decline after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I.\r\n\r\n\"In the last 70, 80 years, we have built mosques that are copies of Ottoman architecture,\" said Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul. \"This wasn't a good development, because the copy can never be as good as the original.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu and her team of artists are hoping to change that.  Look at photos of the mosque \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe Sakirin Mosque was commissioned by a wealthy Turkish Arab family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe designers put a number of contemporary touches on the structure, giving it plate glass walls etched with gold-leaf verses from the Quran, framed by giant cast-iron grids.\r\n\r\nThe mihrab -- the alcove that points worshippers in the direction of Mecca -- is made of asymmetrical ovals, similar to a design used by Fadillioglu to decorate a restaurant in London. And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops.\r\n\r\n\"The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,\" Fadillioglu explained. \"So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the artists here never worked on a mosque before.\r\n\r\n\"It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,\" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. \"If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area. Sort of as if (they are) unwanted in the mosque,\" she said. \"That is not what Islam is about. ... Women are equal in Islam to men\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes' drive from the Sakirin Mosque stands the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, a 16th century structure built by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in honor of his favorite daughter.

And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as \"hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, \"and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption.\" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported.

See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research \u00bb\r\n\r\nResearchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body.

A few days before the embryo would implant in the uterus, it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus.

Vegetables in particular will cost you little in the way of calories while offering huge health benefits.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour weekly goal is to eat five to nine servings of fruits and veggies a day. That's not as challenging as it may seem. The serving sizes are reasonable one medium-size fruit, a half cup of cooked vegetables, three-quarters of a cup of 100-percent juice, one cup of raw leafy vegetables, a quarter cup of dried fruit.\r\r\n\r\r\nMix fruit into your breakfast cereal, add lettuce and tomato to your sandwich (with a side of a vegetable-based soup), eat a piece of fruit in the afternoon and a vegetable side at dinner, and you've taken care of at least five servings.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore shopping, write down the names of five richly colored vegetables and fruits that you really like, then add to the list two that you're curious about and are willing to try.\r\r\n\r\r\nWeek Two: Defy your white flour urge\r\r\n\r\r\nUntil recently, it seemed that only nutritionists (and cereal box labels) used the words whole grain. Now delicious whole grain soups, desserts, and breads --bursting with color, texture and flavor -- have become popular. It's also widely known that they have the power to deliver key antioxidants.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour weekly goal is to make sure that half of your grain servings per day (three to five one-ounce servings) are whole grains such as wild rice, brown rice, barley, bulgur, corn (polenta), faro, quinoa, wheat berries, or whole wheat couscous.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhole grain foods are not refined, which means they contain all three parts of the grain, including the two lost in the refining process -- the outer layer, bran, which provides fiber, B vitamins, and antioxidants; and the germ, the nutrient-packed inner portion, containing protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The endosperm, the starchy part of the grain left in refined products such as white flour, contains some protein and lots of carbs but few nutrients. Look for the word whole on the ingredient list, followed by the name of the grain.\r\r\n\r\r\nResearch shows that adding even a moderate amount of whole grain to your diet every day -- whole grain cereal topped with fruit for breakfast, toasty multigrain bread at lunch, and a pilaf or grain salad for dinner -- significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and digestive system and hormone-related cancers.\r\r\n\r\r\nWeek Three: Get the perks of dairy -- without all the fat\r\r\n\r\r\nThis week, add some reduced-fat dairy, which will cream up your cooking and get healthy calcium into your diet (approximately 75 percent of adult Americans don't get the recommended daily allowance).\r\r\n\r\r\nStudies show not only that calcium helps prevent osteoporosis but that getting enough calcium each day (1,000 milligrams from ages 19 to 50 and 1,200 milligrams after age 50), along with adequate vitamin D (200 IU; 400 IU after age 50), helps control weight, lowers blood pressure, and may prevent certain types of cancer.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour goal is to eat three to four servings a day of low-fat cheeses, yogurt, and 1 percent or skim milk; the calcium in dairy products is the most readily absorbed by your body. If you're lactose intolerant, fortified soy products -- particularly those with calcium malate -- are a fine substitute in cooking and often contain similar amounts of protein, vitamin D, and calcium.\r\r\n\r\r\nI do not recommend fat-free dairy products, particularly cheese; instead of getting creamy, bubbly, and brown in recipes, it can turn rubbery and tasteless.\r\r\n\r\r\nWeek Four: Get protein\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the past three weeks, you have learned how vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat dairy can help you fill your plate with quality nutrients that don't pack a lot of calories. Now it's time to address protein. Getting enough is not something most of us need to worry about, but selecting well is.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour goal is to eat five to six ounces of lean and healthy protein a day. Eat it all in one meal (most restaurant servings of protein are at least five ounces), or eat smaller portions throughout the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nI often tell clients to divide their plate into quarters: Three quarters should be filled with whole grains and vegetables; one quarter should be a serving of protein -- such as shrimp, fish, chicken, beans, tofu, lean cuts of beef, or pork -- about the size of a deck of cards.\r\r\n\r\r\nPoultry and meat can take little time to cook", "3752": "64 percent", "3753": "Democrat or Republican", "3754": "Sally Kern spewed", "3755": "Monday", "3756": "The puzzles", "3757": "over Antarctica", "3758": "Matthew Miller", "3759": "About 50", "3760": "poor record", "3761": "stick-shift", "3762": "Blackwater personnel", "3763": "Romania", "3764": "more young people to become politically active", "3765": "Nebraska", "3766": "Bullring Shopping Centre in Birmingham", "3767": "fourth", "3768": "Germany", "3769": "attempts", "3770": "the river bottom", "3771": "Marek Edelman", "3772": "321", "3773": "the NCAA", "3774": "the wind", "3775": "two of three Americans on board Air France Flight 447 when it crashed Monday.\r\n\r\nThe plane was carrying 228 passengers and crew from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France, when it crashed four hours into the journey.

A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House.\r\n\r\nKennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language.\r\n\r\nRequests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion \"a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions. He acknowledged \"a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion.\"\r\n\r\nOther Catholics questioned Tobin's stance.\r\n\r\n\"The simple fact is that most bishops don't want to deny communion to politicians, and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II gave communion to pro-choice Italian politicians,\" said the Rev.

Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann asked Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to stop receiving communion when she was a pro-choice governor of Kansas, and former St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke said in 2004 he would deny communion to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for being pro-choice.\r\n\r\nBrian McLaren, a longtime Christian pastor who has written a book coming out next year called \"A New Kind of Christianity,\" said politicizing religious views limits the perception and, eventually, the impact of a church's teachings.\r\n\r\n\"Both Catholics and Protestants have allowed themselves to be pushed into this kind of binary, either-or thinking\" on abortion and homosexuality, McLaren said. \"It's disturbing for me as a non-Catholic to see the Catholic Church possibly risking its moral authority on a number of other issues by only focusing on abortion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic church strongly opposes abortion, which has been legal across the United States since 1973.

We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year.\r\n\r\nWe need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ... But without that kind of family support, then we need Boys and Girls Clubs. We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We need mentors. Otherwise, these kids will find bad adults to copy from, and we're going to lose them.\r\n\r\nLemon: I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me.\r\n\r\nLemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort?\r\n\r\nPowell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe've got to teach them that you've got to behave.

On the other end of the spectrum, 37 percent of MySpace members earn less than $50,000 annually, compared with about 28 percent of Facebook users.\r\n\r\nMySpace users tend to be \"in middle-class, blue-collar neighborhoods,\" said Mike Mancini, vice president of data product management for Nielsen, which used an online panel of more than 200,000 social media users in the United States in August. \"They're on their way up, or perhaps not college educated.\"\r\n\r\nBy contrast, Mancini said, \"Facebook [use] goes off the charts in the upscale suburbs,\" driven by a demographic that for Nielsen is represented by white or Asian married couples between the ages of 45-64 with kids and high levels of education.\r\n\r\nEven more affluent are users of Twitter, the microblogging site, and LinkedIn, a networking site geared to white-collar professionals. Almost 38 percent of LinkedIn users earn more than $100,000 a year.\r\n\r\nNielsen also found a strong overlap between those who use Facebook and those who use LinkedIn, Mancini said.\r\n\r\nNielsen isn't the first to find this trend. Ethnographer danah boyd, who does not capitalize her name, said she watched the class divide emerge while conducting research of American teens' use of social networks in 2006.\r\n\r\nWhen she began, she noticed the high school students all used MySpace, but by the end of the school year, they were switching to Facebook.\r\n\r\nWhen boyd asked why, the students replied with reasons similar to Owens: \"the features were better; MySpace is dangerous and Facebook is safe; my friends are here,\" boyd recalled.\r\n\r\nAnd then, boyd said, \"a young woman, living in a small historical town in Massachussetts said to me, 'I don't mean to be a racist or anything, but MySpace is like, ghetto.'\" For boyd, that's when it clicked.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a matter of choice between Facebook and MySpace, it was a movement to Facebook from MySpace,\" she said, a movement that largely included the educated and the upper-class.\r\n\r\nSo why do our online worlds, unencumbered by what separates us in daily life, reflect humans' tendency to stick with what -- and who -- they know?\r\n\r\nA lot of it has to do with the disparate beginnings of MySpace and Facebook, said Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief of Mashable, a blog about social media. Facebook originated at Harvard University and was limited at first to students at approved colleges before opening itself to the public in September 2006.\r\n\r\nMySpace, on the other hand, had a \"come one, come all\" policy and made a mad dash towards monetization, Ostrow said. \"They used a lot of banner ads without regard to the quality, and it really diminished the value [of the site] for the more tech-savvy demographic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the Internet can build bridges between people on opposite sides of the globe, we still tend to connect with the same people through online social networks who we connect with offline, said technology writer and blogger Sarah Perez.\r\n\r\n\"It's effectively a mirror to our real world,\" she told CNN. \"Social networks are the online version of what kids do after school.\"\r\n\r\nThese social-networking divides are worrisome to boyd, who wrote \"Taken Out of Context: American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics.\" Instead of allowing us to cross the boundaries that exist in our everyday lives, these online class differences threaten to carry those boundaries into the future.\r\n\r\n\"The social-network infrastructure is going to be a part of everything going forward, just like [Web] search is,\" boyd said. \"The Internet is not this great equalizer that rids us of the problems of the physical world -- the Internet mirrors and magnifies them. The divisions that we have in everyday life are going to manifest themselves online.\"\r\n\r\nJason Kaufman, a research science fellow with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, examined the Facebook profiles of a group of college students over four years and found that even within Facebook, there's evidence of self-segregation.\r\n\r\nMultiracial students tended to have more Facebook friends than students of other backgrounds and were often the sole connection between white and black circles, Kaufman said.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Kaufman feels that social networks may one day help us overcome our instinct to associate with those who share our income level, education, or racial background.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's fair to say that the Web has great potential to at least mitigate everyday tendencies towards self-segregation and social exclusion,\" Kaufman said. \"In some ways, [Facebook] levels the playing field of friendship stratification. In the real world, you have very close friends and then there are those you just say \"Hi\" to when you pass them on the street.\r\n\r\n\"The playing field is a lot more level in that you can find yourself having a wall-to-wall exchange with just an acquaintance. If you pick up the unlikely friend, not of your race or income bracket, the network may [help you] establish a more active friendship than if you met them in real life.\"\r\n\r\nBut MySpace's users still find something appealing about MySpace that they don't about Facebook, and it may have nothing to do with class or race, blogger Perez said.\r\n\r\n\"It's not just the demographics that have people picking one over the other,\" Perez said. \"It also comes down to what activities you like. If you like music, you'll still be on MySpace. If you're more into applications, then you might go to Facebook because you're addicted to Mafia Wars or whatever.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, boyd isn't as concerned about the reasons behind these divisions online as she is about the consequences of people only networking within their chosen social-media groups.\r\n\r\n\"Friendships and family relationships are socially divided; people self-segregate to deal with racism sometimes,\" she said. \"Okay, fine: We've made a decision to self-segregate, but what happens when politicians go on Facebook and think they're reaching the whole public? What happens when colleges only go on Facebook to promote?\"\r\n\r\nWhen and if that does happen, Mashable's Ostrow said, we'll know perhaps we've given social networks more credit than they're worth. \"When it comes to information, I don't think social networks are the best source for that. The Internet is so open,\" said Ostrow, who believes users would go beyond their networks to search out information online.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to branch out of your social network box, your best option may be Twitter.

I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy.

They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance.

I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi.\r\n\r\nI trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.\r\n\r\nBy mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way.\r\n\r\nFinally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel.

We talk to his parents about the practice regime they implemented from the age of 4, and the ruthless work ethic that they believe has brought him success.\r\n\r\nLang Lang has made it his mission to share classical music around the world, with an emphasis on training children through outreach programs. Following his performance at the opening of Beijing's 2008 Olympic Games, he became a symbol of the youth and future of China. This status has inspired over 35 million Chinese children to learn to play classical piano - a phenomenon popularly referred to as \"the Lang Lang effect.\" Revealed documents the days leading up to Lang Lang's next major Chinese performance. He has been selected by the government to perform in celebrations of the 60-year Anniversary of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, a fitting performance for the prodigy who is seen to embody modern China.\r\n\r\nThe frenzy surrounding Lang Lang in China inspired iconic piano maker Steinway to create their first piano branded in someone's name.

We will evaluate each sector, from the service side, finance, accounting. And any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth, then we will focus on that: on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company.\r\n\r\nDefterios: If you look at the Middle East, specifically within this Gulf region, it's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership. Is this society in the region ready for this move?\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: Interestingly, the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside. We host 200 nationalities, so for us, the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community. So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path: it's an organic path to continue the openness that exists.\r\n\r\nForeign direct investment is not your own wealth. When you have your own wealth, you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes, because it's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at foreign direct investment, it mandates you to be much more transparent, you have to be very diligent about your work, and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment.\r\n\r\nDefterios: It's interesting, you read the front line of the DP World, P&O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress. What are the lessons, not just from the UAE perspective, but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process?\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: First of all, I think it is important to understand, in this global world, there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere. Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad. We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places.\r\n\r\nDefterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment.\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us. If today I lock up my investment opportunity here, money will not come to me, money will go somewhere else. When I have investment coming from abroad, it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image'.\r\n\r\nSo when I say it, I am not directing this as a message to a particular country. I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation, when it comes to responsibility, when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country. So that's really a lesson that's very very critical.\r\n\r\nDefterios: A number of firsts: the first to start a B2B marketplace; the first female minister within the country, an economy minister; and the first to launch a perfume range as well. What is it all about? Trailblazing, setting examples, being an entrepreneur? How would you describe what you're doing here?\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: Everybody laughs about the perfume. One, I think the United Arab Emirates, since inception (it's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed) has always given equal opportunities for women. But it's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push, and what it is that we can do and not do.\r\n\r\nIn my personal belief you need a bridge, you need a door opener for women. And sometimes women do not want to take the risk. Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving. I had the opportunity and I had the trust from the government and the community, so to me, it is setting the example internally for the young women, and men by the way. Be it in technology, or economy or e-commerce.\r\n\r\nDefterios: And the perfume line is the exclamation point?\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: A young woman", "4937": "English", "4938": "1970s", "4939": "more than 24", "4940": "Democrats", "4941": "American Book Award-winning and NAACP Image Award-winning novelist", "4942": "friends with polar wildlife, photographing seals, polar bears, narwhals and others in remarkable closeups.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Nicklen, a contributing photographer for the National Geographic, is passing along a message from the creatures he sees in the Arctic and Antarctica: They're in trouble.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe reason is that the sea ice is disappearing, removing a key element from the environment sustaining life.\r\r\n\r\r\nNicklen, whose work has been recognized with multiple awards, tracked the rare spirit bear for a National Geographic cover story.

While Knox is aware of the seriousness of her situation, Polidori said, she is \"resolute\" about proving her innocence.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox was convicted earlier this month of murdering British exchange student Meredith Kercher while the two roomed together in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. During her trial, Knox read a statement to jurors, insisting she is not a killer. She is appealing her conviction, although her case might not reach a court docket for at least a year.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox told the visitors she trusts in the Italian justice system to resolve her case, Polidori said. However, she said she was scared, and that \"she is often afraid to open [the] newspaper or watch TV,\" because media reports tend to undermine her confidence, Polidori said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Italy USA Foundation \"was established to honor the friendship between Italians and Americans,\" according to its Web site. \"The Foundation is an independent institution that intends to play a bipartisan role on both sides of the Atlantic and whose sole purpose is to promote friendship between Italy and the United States of America.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe foundation's president, Rocco Girlanda, said in a statement on the Web site the delegation visited Knox in her cell in Perugia to check on her condition because of the intense U.S. interest in her case. The delegation brought Knox some English-language books as a Christmas gift, which made her \"really happy,\" Polidori told CNN.\r\r\n\r\r\nProsecutors said Kercher died during a sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher while Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffale Sollecito, and another man, Rudy Guede, sexually assaulted her. Among the evidence against Knox was a knife found in Sollecito's house with Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox's attorneys attempted to cast doubt on those findings, saying the knife did not match Kercher's wounds or a knife imprint left on a bedsheet. They also claimed the DNA sample was too small to be conclusive.\r\r\n\r\r\nSollecito was also convicted in Kercher's death and sentenced to 25 years. Guede was convicted earlier in a separate fast-track trial and is appealing his conviction.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe verdict against Knox drew criticism from some who questioned the process.
