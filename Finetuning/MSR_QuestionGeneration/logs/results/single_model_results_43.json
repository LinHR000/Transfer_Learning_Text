The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \"With its this-is-really-happening vibe, 'Paranormal Activity' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich\u00e9s. The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the film has earned a strong 85 percent approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\r\n\r\nMoviegoers agree. Rajiim Gross, an iReporter who posted a review of the film, said he found \"Paranormal Activity\" to be much better than \"Blair Witch Project,\" another indie-horror film to which it is being compared.

The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S. The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Watch three detection puppies in action \u00bb\r\n\r\nOfficial records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S. In more recent years, police departments realized a dog's nose was a valuable asset.\r\n\r\nDogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others. For each drop of odor detected by a dog, the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000 drops of odor, veterinarians say.  Can your pooch be a detection dog? \u00bb\r\n\r\nOther animals may have smelling skills that rival a dog's, such as pigs nosing for truffles in France or honey bees that can sniff out TNT particles, but veterinarians say dogs are the most controllable and sociable for their human handlers.\r\n\r\nPolice dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection, police officers say. Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats. They can find children who have mysteriously vanished overnight. Detection dogs can even weed out pest-infested apples and oranges accidentally left in suitcases at airports.\r\n\r\n\"They are a growing aspect of law enforcement,\" says Jim Watson, secretary at the North American Police Work Dog Association and a handler for decades.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, investigators were baffled during the international manhunt for George Zinkhan, a former University of Georgia professor accused of fatally shooting his wife and two other people.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks into the search, two cadaver dogs, a German shepherd named Circe and an Australian shepherd named Madison, arrived. Within 10 hours, the dogs picked up the scent of Zinkhan's remains in a shallow pit hidden in a thick forest. Once the dogs neared the suspect's body, they gave their handlers personalized signals. Circe barked excitedly. Madison lay down.\r\n\r\nTrainer Jeff Schettler explains Kaden is an unlikely candidate for police work. Basenjis, a breed that originated in central Africa, are usually used as hunting or show dogs. There are only two other trained police dog basenjis recorded by the North American Police Work Dog Association.\r\n\r\nMost trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs, preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record. Most law enforcement agencies rely on Belgian Malinoises and German shepherds for detection work because of their protective yet friendly personalities, but labs, bloodhounds and beagles also can be used.\r\n\r\n\"We're not trying to fix anything,\" Schettler says. \"We're trying to enhance it.\"\r\n\r\nSchettler points out some of Kaden's advantages: The dog's weight will peak at about 25 pounds, enabling him seamlessly to sift between cramped luggage and lockers. Kaden is barkless because basenjis have an oddly shaped larynx, ideal for quiet searches.\r\n\r\nOn a recent rainy Saturday morning at the Georgia K9 National Training Center, little Kaden undergoes testing. Passing the exam depends on his whiffing talents.\r\n\r\nUpon the instructor's command, Kaden's pencil-thin legs playfully trot along the damp grass to an oversize wall scattered with dozens of holes. His instructor has hidden black gunpowder wrapped in pantyhose in one of the holes.\r\n\r\nIf Kaden's nose sniffs out the gunpowder, he will immediately sit.\r\n\r\nKaden begins on the left side, quickly taking a zigzag pattern from one hole to another. His pace is methodical, a sniff for each hole. Soon he slows, pauses, inhales again and then sinks his tiny hindquarters to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"What a good boy,\" coo several of Kaden's trainers, stroking his sleek fur and rewarding him with one of his favorite treats, torn bits of venison jerky.\r\n\r\nAs Kaden nibbles on his treat, Schettler admits there are drawbacks to training basenjis. Basenjis don't have a furry coat to endure cold weather like a German shepherd.\r\n\r\nBasenjis are also a highly independent, stubborn breed with personalities similar to cats, making them difficult to train. Kaden's personality, however, is contrary to most basenjis. He was culled from a litter in Atlanta at 7 days old because of his unusual sociability with humans.\r\n\r\n\"At eight weeks, he was in the airport going up to people and running around like he owned the place,\" Schettler says.\r\n\r\nTraining detection dogs such as Kaden often begins during puppyhood so imprinting scent differentiation becomes innate, handlers say. Puppies are selected based on breed purity, confidence, sociability and temperament", "467": "4 in 10 have not heard of the movement or don't know enough to form an opinion.

If families can afford it, she recommends a reverse osmosis filter, which will eliminate all impurities.\r\n\r\nThese reports come as food safety concerns seem to be at an all-time high. Lately, recalls of spinach, sprouts, peanut butter, and, most recently, cookie dough have made many consumers start to question the safety of the items they find on grocery-store shelves.\r\n\r\nUnlike tap water suppliers, bottled water companies don't have to have their water tested by a certified laboratory, and they aren't required to notify customers within 24 hours if they find elevated levels of contaminants.

Health.com: Could your rug make you sick?\r\n\r\nIf the companies fail, however, the public doesn't get to see the actual test results. \"There's clearly a difference in disclosure between municipal water and bottled water, but the FDA's laws focus on safety of food more than on disclosure of information,\" says Sharfstein. \"It's not a question of whether the FDA can do more; it's whether the government can do more through the food safety bill", "490": "exchange text messages while driving because, well, they're teenagers and teenagers sometimes do dumb things.

See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research \u00bb\r\n\r\nResearchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body. Stem cells have this ability for a short time. A few days before the embryo would implant in the uterus, it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus.  Watch a doctor explain why embryotic stem cells are so important \u00bb\r\n\r\nWhen the embryo is 4 or 5 days old, scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish. With the removal of these stem cells -- of which there may be about 30 -- the embryo is destroyed.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one of the 60 stem cell lines authorized for research under the Bush policy have proven useful to researchers. Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Bush maintained that scientific advances allowed researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos.\r\n\r\nConservative leaders echoed Bush's rationale in their criticism of Obama's decision.\r\n\r\n\"Advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington, D.C., and breakthroughs announced in recent years confirm the full potential of stem cell research can be realized without the destruction of living human embryos,\" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Sunday.\r\n\r\nSen.

Then, there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child, a portrait of innocence.

There was, though, a stunning transformation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph. Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the fall of 2008, Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year, alongside some of the world's most impressive women. She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere is a tell-all book, which is to be published in more than 20 languages, and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's strength was celebrated by complete strangers. But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform?\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There is no change at all since going on television,\" Nujood says bitterly. \"I hoped there was someone to help us, but we didn't find anyone.

We filmed what we could around the base and made the best of a bad situation by doing a few live shots with details about the attack gleaned from our sources.\r\r\n\r\r\nMy frustration began to dissipate fairly quickly the following day. I realized we might have been in the wrong place to see the attack but we were in exactly the right place to see how the Sudanese government controlled the U.N. peacekeepers. For the most part they didn't go out and their Force Commander General Martin Luther Agwai was grounded.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat morning we went to the airport to join Agwai on a flight. When we got there Sudanese officials there said the U.N. couldn't fly even though commercial aircraft were free to come and go as they needed.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's when you stand there face-to-face with the situation and the people responsible that you see who has the power, who calls the shots. The U.N. was powerless. That was a real eye-opener, but it was still a challenge to get it across on TV. We couldn't pull the camera out and shoot the whole sequence.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe story was, the general couldn't work, and as the general was our story, if he wasn't doing anything we had nothing to shoot -- a sort of catch-22.\r\r\n\r\r\nFortunately cameraman Scottie is an old hand at these situations and we'd gone in prepared. I had my radio microphone, so I could leave Scottie in the vehicle shooting me while I wandered around outside and he could still pick up what I was saying. No one would be any the wiser. We sneaked in a few reports at the gates to the airport that way.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt made us feel better to be getting something in the can. The rest of the day was to be even more interesting. As we couldn't go anywhere, we were able to get more briefs and shoot a few interviews.\r\r\n\r\r\nI was starting to learn things that were shocking me. Not least, that the U.N. had no power over the Sudanese government, but, for example, some of the female gate guards the U.N. employed were from the displacement camps.\r\r\n\r\r\nFair enough, I thought, until I found out their husbands were away fighting for the rebels. The U.N. was effectively freeing men to keep the war going by supporting their families.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat night when we got back to our house, I wrote of list of everything shocking I'd learned that day. I would be adding to it for the rest of my stay.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor example, rebels recruit in aid camps. Sometimes people in the camps won't let the aid workers in. And one that really caught me by surprise: The international community had been paying rebels millions of dollars to abide by a 2006 cease-fire agreement.\r\r\n\r\r\nMany rebels had splintered their groups to get a bigger chunk of the cash.

The raw material can be any forest, agricultural or animal waste. Some examples are woodchips, corn husks, peanut shells, even chicken manure.\r\n\r\nBibens feeds the waste -- called \"biomass\" -- into an octagonally shaped metal barrel where it is cooked under intense heat, sometimes above 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the organic matter is cooked through a thermochemical process called \"pyrolysis\".\r\n\r\nIn a few hours, organic trash is transformed into charcoal-like pellets farmers can turn into fertilizer.  Gasses given off during the process can be harnesed to fuel vehicles of power electric generators.  Watch how biochar is made and why it's important \u00bb\r\n\r\nBiochar is considered by many scientists to be the \"black gold\" for agriculture.\r\n\r\nIts high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground.\r\n\r\nBiochar helps clean the air two ways: by preventing rotting biomass from releasing harmful CO2 into the atmosphere, and by allowing plants to safely store CO2 they pull out of the air during photosynthesis.  See more about how biochar works \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere,\" said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar. \"It gives us a chance to produce carbon negative energy", "967": "The Bullring Shopping Centre", "968": "Violence", "969": "Maurice Jarre \u00bb\n\nJarre", "970": "80 percent", "971": "Wednesday.\r\n\r\nJoy Behar and her co-hosts on \"The View\" were recently named on the Time 100 most influential list.\r\n\r\n\"The View\" co-host discussed a variety of topics, including the Miss California USA pageant, her feud with Donald Trump and Alaska Gov.

Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nKathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year.

Carson made medical history in 1987 by performing the first successful surgery that separated twins conjoined at the back of the head. He also became known for his expertise in pediatric brain tumors and methods of controlling seizures. In 2008, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, this country's highest civilian honor.\r\n\r\nHaving come up from the streets of Detroit, Michigan, to receiving an award at the White House, Carson, 56, works to spread his gospel of education and hard work to motivate others.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife, Candy, started a scholarship foundation to help children with strong academics and humanitarian qualities to pay for college.\r\n\r\n\"I have at least 100,000 letters from kids and adults from around the world ... telling me how it changed their lives,\" Carson said. Their tales of transformations and redemption inspire him to keep talking about educational empowerment and overcoming adversity, he said.\r\n\r\nAn obstacle is a hurdle, and \"you jump over it,\" Carson said.  \"Every time you see a hurdle, you jump over it, and it strengthens you for the next one. And if that's the case, you lead a victorious life, because whatever comes before you, you know you're going to get around it.\"\r\n\r\nCarson was raised in Detroit, majored in psychology at Yale University and attended medical school at the University of Michigan, where he studied neurosurgery.\r\n\r\nCarson's life has been told through plays, books and movies, including a TNT made-for-TV movie called \"Gifted Hands,\" which airs Saturday. (TNT is part of Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN.) The biopic stars Academy Award winner Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carson.\r\n\r\n\"I think he's an angel, a gift from God,\"  Gooding said. \"He has touched a lot of people's lives.\"\r\n\r\nCarson holds more than 50 honorary doctorates and hundreds of other awards.

She wouldn't let us accept the victim mentality. No excuses. She didn't make excuses, and she didn't accept excuses,\" Carson said.\r\n\r\nShe turned off the TV, sent Carson and his brother to the library and made them write weekly book reports. Meanwhile, she worked several jobs to support her two sons. She is now 80 and lives with Carson in Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n\r\nWhen Carson was young, he was influenced by stories about Booker T. Washington, a former slave who taught himself to read and later advised presidents, and the biblical character Joseph, who persevered though his brothers sold him into slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Those kinds of stories had an impact on me and helped me to believe it's not where you started, it's where you end that counts. And you have a whole lot to do with that,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody has problems. They just come in different forms. If that problem for you becomes a containing fence, then you become a victim. Once you think you're a victim, you are one, and you're not going anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way, Carson's biography has resonated with people like 22-year-old Douglas Nivens II of Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n\r\nNivens' mother was killed when he was 4 years old, and his father was imprisoned for her murder. His aunt raised him, and he endured relentless teasing for his interest in academics while attending public schools in Baltimore City. During middle school, Nivens picked up Carson's autobiography, \"Gifted Hands,\" and immediately identified with it.\r\n\r\n\"It was a relief to see someone grew up in the city and didn't have a luxurious life but overcame it all,\" he said. \"I love stories about underdogs, those who overcome adversity and do something.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was in middle school, Nivens won two $1,000 scholarships from the Carson Scholars Fund, which helps children with strong academics pay for college.\r\n\r\n\"When it came to times of doubt during high school, when I talked to my adviser, they would say, 'You got this award. Not everyone gets it. You're not dumb. You have the tools to be successful in life,' \" Nivens said. \"That's what really helped me in terms of self-esteem and management in high school.\"\r\n\r\nHe graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in May.\r\n\r\n\"I probably should not be where I am,\" said Nivens, a budget analyst for the U.S. Social Security Administration. \"I went to Baltimore public schools. My father's in jail; my mother is dead. Statistically, I should not be here. I should be on parole somewhere or even dead. I never looked at it that way.

The video was downloaded to YouTube in February and surfaced a week ago to wider attention.\r\n\r\n\"We are not going to let Chileans pass by,\" Donayre says in the amateur-quality video as he offers a toast. \"Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags.\"\r\n\r\nTensions rose over the weekend when Donayre, who is scheduled to retire Friday, was widely quoted in Peru and Chile as saying that he will not be forced to resign early due to external pressure.\r\n\r\n\"I was named commander general under a presidential mandate and I can only be relieved under such an order. Not by necessity nor under pressure from another government,\" Donayre said, acording to the Peruvian Andina news agency.\r\n\r\nFurther heightening tensions, Donayre was quoted as saying that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they want at private functions.\r\n\r\n\"I want to express and specify that it was not a speech nor a public act,\" Andina quotes the general as saying. \"The situation in which what happened at a private gathering was spread worries me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the video, Donayre is surrounded by other uniformed army officials as well as people in civilian dress. It is not clear from the video in what context the general was making his comments. Nor was it clear in what forum Donayre made his comments over the weekend.\r\n\r\nAfter Bachelet's meeting with top aides Monday, government spokesman Francisco Vidal declined to say whether Chile's ambassador to Peru would be recalled in light of Donayre's weekend statements.\r\n\r\n\"General Donayre's declarations in the past 24 to 48 hours only convince us that we are right and that our government's posture is reasonable,\" Vidal said on the Chilean government Web site.\r\n\r\nIn Peru, meanwhile, a member of Congress, Gustavo Espinoza, is under investigation, suspected of sending Donayre's videotaped comment to Chilean press and politicians.\r\n\r\nA political opponent said Espinoza has an \"unpatriotic attitude,\" the Andina news agency said.\r\n\r\n\"I would not have expected this conduct from any Peruvian, much less a member of Congress,\" said Aurelio Pastor.\r\n\r\nEspinoza is already serving a 120-day suspension for leaking a private conversation with another member of Congress, Andina said.\r\n\r\nPeruvian Defense Minister \u00c1ntero Flores-Ar\u00e1oz told reporters Saturday that relations between the two nations will be repaired, calling the Donayre incident \"a bump in the road.\"\r\n\r\nFlores-Ar\u00e1oz also said that Donayre's remarks about Chileans used \"improper terms", "1332": "a scientist", "1333": "The round-ups began May 28", "1334": "Los Angeles in the last week.\r\n\r\n\"We opened the door at 5:30 and there were 600-odd people already gathered,\" he told CNN.\r\n\r\nOver the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock.\r\n\r\nTuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles", "1335": "second", "1336": "white supremacy groups", "1337": "second", "1338": "acute watery diarrhoea", "1339": "Lewis", "1340": "Saddam Hussein's eldest daughter", "1341": "Swiss justice authorities", "1342": "continued corruption", "1343": "Larry King Live\" Wednesday.\r\n\r\nJoy Behar", "1344": "the president's budget", "1345": "one", "1346": "63 percent", "1347": "Southern California to panic, but they should keep an eye on Jimena, Berg said.\r\n\r\n\"There's no watches or warnings in effect, but we would like residents and tourists in the area", "1348": "Powering up iPhone", "1349": "right thigh bone", "1350": "1974", "1351": "the home and about 20", "1352": "criminals", "1353": "one", "1354": "Liam Gallagher", "1355": "471", "1356": "Gerets", "1357": "Obama", "1358": "Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala and Panama", "1359": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A suicide car bombing exploded outside the NATO headquarters in Afghanistan", "1360": "The National Assembly voted in favor of Sarkozy's plan, 329-238.\r\n\r\nSocialist Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, told Prime Minister Francois Fillon: \"You tell us this would mean more independence and more influence.

Knox is also grateful for the foundation's interest in her case, Polidori said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In my opinion, in spite of the imprisonment, she seemed to be serene,\" Polidori told CNN. While Knox is aware of the seriousness of her situation, Polidori said, she is \"resolute\" about proving her innocence.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox was convicted earlier this month of murdering British exchange student Meredith Kercher while the two roomed together in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. During her trial, Knox read a statement to jurors, insisting she is not a killer. She is appealing her conviction, although her case might not reach a court docket for at least a year.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox told the visitors she trusts in the Italian justice system to resolve her case, Polidori said. However, she said she was scared, and that \"she is often afraid to open [the] newspaper or watch TV,\" because media reports tend to undermine her confidence, Polidori said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Italy USA Foundation \"was established to honor the friendship between Italians and Americans,\" according to its Web site. \"The Foundation is an independent institution that intends to play a bipartisan role on both sides of the Atlantic and whose sole purpose is to promote friendship between Italy and the United States of America.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe foundation's president, Rocco Girlanda, said in a statement on the Web site the delegation visited Knox in her cell in Perugia to check on her condition because of the intense U.S. interest in her case. The delegation brought Knox some English-language books as a Christmas gift, which made her \"really happy,\" Polidori told CNN.\r\r\n\r\r\nProsecutors said Kercher died during a sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher while Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffale Sollecito, and another man, Rudy Guede, sexually assaulted her. Among the evidence against Knox was a knife found in Sollecito's house with Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox's attorneys attempted to cast doubt on those findings, saying the knife did not match Kercher's wounds or a knife imprint left on a bedsheet. They also claimed the DNA sample was too small to be conclusive.\r\r\n\r\r\nSollecito was also convicted in Kercher's death and sentenced to 25 years. Guede was convicted earlier in a separate fast-track trial and is appealing his conviction.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe verdict against Knox drew criticism from some who questioned the process. Kercher's family, however, has said they were satisfied with the jurors' decision.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox said she misses her family, Polidori said.

Reem couldn't remember a lot of them, but she had some moments left in her memory -- usually the happy moments of her life -- and those memories were the basis for today's Reem, the 22-year-old girl who is ME.\r\n\r\nI remember how happy I was when my teacher announced to the school that I was first in my class. I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet.\r\n\r\nI can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration.\r\n\r\nI can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth \u00bb\r\n\r\nSometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place.\r\n\r\nBut life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school.\r\n\r\nI was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media.\r\n\r\nAll my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally.\r\n\r\nMy ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian.\r\n\r\nUsually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be.\r\n\r\nIt's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom.\r\n\r\nI found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States", "2098": "74", "2099": "southwestern Michigan", "2100": "blocked the search engine's camera car from photographing their homes.\n\nBroughton, can be seen from the air on Google Earth, but not from the ground.\n\nFearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the Web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets, villagers in Broughton, north of London, summoned the police after spotting the car", "2101": "deliberate and repeated research misconduct", "2102": "Reinhard and Christine Lenz", "2103": "100,000", "2104": "Sunni Arab Anbar province was a battleground between the U.S. military and al Qaeda in Iraq during the earlier years of the Iraq war.\r\n\r\nBut the insurgents eventually lost ground when a grass-roots movement", "2105": "permanent weight loss", "2106": "cracking down on organized crime", "2107": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- As Ricot Duprevil tells it, rescuers saved him after he spent two weeks under earthquake rubble.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere's no question that Duprevil was pulled out alive", "2108": "the children's home city of Mumbai", "2109": "1990s", "2110": "10 to 15 thousand", "2111": "U.S. policies", "2112": "real action against racism", "2113": "a mushroom cloud of flames lit", "2114": "Naples, Italy", "2115": "southeastern section", "2116": "U.S. President Jimmy Carter watches UK PM", "2117": "The Lord's Resistance Army", "2118": "Pierre Balthazard", "2119": "New York", "2120": "southeastern Utah", "2121": "work-in-progress", "2122": "Serbian", "2123": "the streets of Urumqi", "2124": "Abraham", "2125": "Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide has announced that he is ready to return home to help rebuild his earthquake-shattered country.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe former president has been living in South Africa since fleeing Haiti during a violent uprising in 2004.\r\r\n\r\r\nAristide told reporters gathered at a hotel near Johannesburg's international airport that he is ready to return from exile as soon as today.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"To symbolize our readiness we have decided to meet not just anywhere but here in the shadow of the Oliver Tambo International airport,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"As far as we are concerned we are ready to leave today, tomorrow, at any time to join the people of Haiti, to share in their suffering, help rebuild the country moving from misery to poverty with dignity.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGet the latest developments in Haiti\r\r\n\r\r\nA massive international rescue operation is under way to treat the thousands of survivors trapped and injured by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Tuesday.\r\r\n\r\r\nAristide said he and his wife were planning to fly to Haiti with friends who were ferrying emergency medical supplies to the country.\r\r\n\r\r\nImpact Your World\r\r\n\r\r\nIt is not clear whether Aristide has sought formal permission from the Haitian government to return.

Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president.  See how 'SNL' has portrayed presidents \u00bb  President Gerald Ford, a gifted athlete, could never overcome the image of a bumbling, clumsy man who banged his head constantly after the hilarious portrayal of him by Chevy Chase. The senior Bush, George H.W., was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey, and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy, inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions.\r\n\r\nBut the real question being debated on cable TV because of the \"SNL\" parody is this: \"Has the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?\"\r\n\r\nI can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats will add pensively to the words: \"Not Done\" from the \"SNL\" skit, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans would add assertively : \"Not ever!\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \"Camelot II\"; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office.

The audience listened with rapt attention as Josh and several other Americans directly impacted by our broken immigration laws recounted their haunting tales.\r\n\r\nOur current immigration system is broken and greatly in need of reform. In order to create real, long-lasting reform, we must create a pathway to legal status for the millions of undocumented immigrants who have made lives for themselves and their families in the United States. It is essential for our national security to know who resides within our borders.\r\n\r\nAnd this phenomenon is not unique to Colorado; throughout the country, Americans agree that it is time to reform our broken immigration system.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent poll of 1,000 voters by the Benenson Strategy Group, more than eight in 10 Democratic, Republican and independent voters support Congress passing comprehensive reform, as do 86 percent of voters who are undecided on the 2010 congressional race. Only 14 percent oppose the reform.\r\n\r\nAmericans agree that comprehensive immigration reform is fair to both taxpayers (81 percent agree) and illegal immigrants (79 percent agree), and 91 percent agree that the comprehensive proposal would help taxpayers by making illegal immigrants pay taxes.\r\n\r\nIf we secure our borders and crack down on employers who illegally hire, and deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, nearly seven in 10 (68 percent) voters argue that the remaining 12 million illegal immigrants should be required to register, meet conditions and eventually be allowed to apply for citizenship. A whopping 62 percent of self-identified Republicans say they should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship.\r\n\r\nClearly, Americans agree that the economic and national security burdens placed on state and local governments -- not to mention the incredible hardships placed on immigrant families -- because of the failures of federal immigration policy are unfair and that we desperately need meaningful reform. It is rare to find this kind of across-the-board consensus, and it indicates that rather than demagoguery, the American people want action.\r\n\r\nOur town hall's other special guest, my colleague Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, formed the United Families movement. It works to bring diverse groups to the table from faith-based organizations, civil rights groups, unions and businesses to demand comprehensive immigration reform.\r\n\r\nThanks to their leadership, progressives and conservatives in Colorado and across the country are working to urge President Obama and Congress to take it up this year.\r\n\r\nAmnesty alone is not the solution. We need real reform. We tried amnesty in the late 1980s, and because we never took serious steps at enforcement, we wound up in precisely the same predicament 20 years later. If all we do is pass amnesty, we will likely be having the same debate again a few years.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the \"enforcement-only\" policies of the past few years have failed and have resulted only in even more illegal immigration and the separation of American families. Trying to enforce our out-of-touch laws is as foolish and impossible as trying to enforce a law requiring that water flow uphill.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that we can solve this issue. We can pass practical comprehensive immigration reform. Crafting a solution to this complex problem will require a debate, which should begin without delay. Citizens and elected leaders of this great nation must realize our common goal of putting an end to illegal immigration and demand immigration reform now.\r\n\r\nWe are a nation of immigrants.

A series of exercises, lectures, and meditations stretched over 10 months, Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people's lives.\r\n\r\nLike some participants, Joan, who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at Spirit Rock, initially balked at the idea of singing. \"I thought James wanted me to join a choir,\" she says, \"but I took it on faith that the singing was going to work.\" So she started trilling along with the \"Hairspray\" soundtrack while driving. \"It seemed ridiculous, but that's what initially helped me the most.\"\r\n\r\n\"The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being,\" says Baraz. \"In other words, it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good.\" The first and most important step, he says, is intention: making the decision to be happy.\r\n\r\nRobert Holden, Ph.D., author of \"Happiness Now! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast\" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. \"Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow. For centuries, optimists and pessimists have argued over who's right, and the answer is they both are; each sees what they're looking for. If you focus on happiness, that's what you become more aware of.\"\r\n\r\nOnce participants have made up their minds to be happier, Baraz gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in Berkeley and in twice-monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind", "2466": "Peru", "2467": "at least two and a half hours", "2468": "McCurry", "2469": "Tampa", "2470": "nature's waste disposal units. Or rather, it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units, as they don't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful: nutrient-rich compost.\r\n\r\nEarthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly, in this context: The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus, which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting, according to CityFarmer.org. Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day, but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process, according to The Ecologist.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of them, too. You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land, according to NatureWatch, their population doubling in size every one-two months. And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves, stems and dead roots in one year, ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process.\r\n\r\nWhat they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients. According to NatureWatch, earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen, seven times as much phosphorous, 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more \"beneficial bacteria\" than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place. Literally speaking, what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out.\r\n\r\nUtilizing 'black gold'\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise why these worms' byproducts are often referred to as \"black gold,\" this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world's agricultural soil has become \"seriously degraded,\" according to the UK Soil Association.\r\n\r\nWorm compost:\r\n\r\nJust one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days, according to ScienceDaily. And plants love it. Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting, by as much as 40 percent for broccoli, 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots, according to The Ecologist.\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Waste Survey, compiled by Veolia Environmental Services, we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004. And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted. Around 32 percent of the European Union's annual municipal waste (around 120 million tons) is food and garden waste, according to Waste Management World. And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill, emitting methane into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste, vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places. In Hong Kong, none other than fast-food chain McDonald's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day, according to the Reuters news service. McDonald's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to Hong Kong's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent, Reuters reports.\r\n\r\nOther companies to have experimented with worm composting include Ikea in the U.S. state of Illinois, where, according to Treehugger.com, it is conducting vermicomposting trials. If all goes well, it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent, the site says.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, we have had this knowledge for centuries. Aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the \"intestines of the soil,\" according to The New York Times, which also points out that Cleopatra was another devotee, bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected. Charles Darwin admired their land-tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them. \"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures,\" he mused, according to The New York Times.\r\n\r\nGreenhouse gas emitters\r\n\r\nWhat Darwin, Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however, is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste.\r\n\r\nScientists in India have found that worms' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure. According to the Indian newspaper, India Together, researchers in Gujarat have found that worms can \"detox\" the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste.\r\n\r\nThe method is ideal for industries -- such as paper, food processing, oil, textiles, dairy, distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge, Indian researchers say.\r\n\r\nBut even with vermicomposting, something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around, there's a downside -- and it's a rather large one.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size, reports the UK's Telegraph newspaper.\r\n\r\n\"The emissions that come from these worms can actually be 290 times more potent than carbon dioxide and 20 times more potent than methane,\" the Telegraph quotes Jim Frederickson, an Open University research fellow.\r\n\r\n\"In all environmental systems you get good points and bad points", "2471": "local and federal task force", "2472": "U.N.

Billions of dollars have been spent transforming the landscape, erecting buildings which continue to break records of all dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe Burj Dubai -- at 818 meter the world's tallest skyscraper, the vast Palm Jumeirah -- built on land reclaimed from the sea, the Dubai Mall -- the largest shopping center in the world and the Mall of the Emirates; home to the world's biggest indoor ski slope form part of a very long list of completed construction projects.\r\n\r\n\"The whole place is kind of like a time-lapse film. You wake up in the morning and it's just a little bit different,\" Jim Krane, author of \"City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism\" told CNN.\r\n\r\nBut, according to Krane, some of these projects, like the Burj Dubai, suffer from a severe lack of practicality.\r\n\r\n\"Dubai doesn't really need to have to build tall asides from prestige purposes. If you look at it, it's a really bad idea. It uses as much electricity as an entire city. And every time the toilet is flushed they've got to pump water half a mile into the sky,\" he said\r\n\r\nThe telescopic shape is also presents problems of a more practical nature Krane thinks.\r\n\r\n\"The upper 30 or 40 floors are so tiny that they're useless, so they can't use them for anything else apart from storage. They've built a small, not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis prestige over practicality issue something of a recurring theme in Dubai's banner building projects.\r\n\r\nKrane, who lived and worked in Dubai from 2005 to 2007, also called into questions the attraction of the Palm Islands.

According to Sharfstein, the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nBisphenol-A is found in many products, but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula, and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys. A handful of states and cities including Minnesota, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, have passed laws in some form banning BPA in products meant for children.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position is a partial reversal of the FDA's declaration in 2008 that BPA has no adverse effects. That announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry-funded research.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince then, the agency says on its Web site, \"recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals. While BPA is not proven to harm children or adults, these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of BPA.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program, which in its own 2008 report said there is \"some concern\" for BPA's effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. Other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the authors of those studies say it's not clear the problems were actually caused by BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt a news conference Friday, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said further research is needed \"to determine if and when further action is needed.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has been allotted $30 million to study the health effects of BPA.

Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for \"e-waste\" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nSome of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 a Greenpeace study, \"Not in My Backyard\", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\r\n\r\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\r\n\r\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\r\n\r\nIt's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading.\r\n\r\nThe volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste.\r\n\r\nEach one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years.\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market.\r\n\r\n\"Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,\" said Schoppink.\r\n\r\n\"It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem.\r\n\r\n\"The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it. The export of e-waste from the EU is illegal under the Basel Convention and the Waste Shipment Directive, but the laws are not being sufficiently implemented. In the U.S., there is no such law banning this practice.\r\n\r\n\"In Nigeria the government is talking about stopping imports, but there has been no progress on this to date.\"\r\n\r\nSigns of progress\r\n\r\nThere are calls from environmental groups likes Greenpeace for electronics producers to do more to phase out their use of hazardous substances, and there are some signs of progress.\r\n\r\nSeveral electronics companies already make products using fewer hazardous substances, and others, including Nokia, Philips and Samsung are setting up voluntary collection and recycling systems in countries where they are not legally obliged to. Apple claims its products are now almost entirely free of the worst toxic chemicals.\r\n\r\n\"If producers continue to use hazardous chemicals in their electronics and to fail to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products, e-waste will continue to be dumped in developing countries,\" said Schoppink.\r\n\r\n\"The pollution and related health problems in countries where e-waste is dumped will increase massively as the amount of electronics used worldwide is growing exponentially and the number of countries used as dump sites will grow.\"\r\n\r\nBut while the developing world needs the U.S. and EU", "3236": "chase happiness", "3237": "global slump in property prices", "3238": "Belarus", "3239": "Baytown and Beaumont, Texas", "3240": "earthquake-shattered country.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe former president has been living in South Africa since fleeing Haiti during a violent uprising in 2004.\r\r\n\r\r\nAristide told reporters gathered at a hotel near Johannesburg's international airport that he is ready to return from exile as soon as today.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"To symbolize our readiness we have decided to meet not just anywhere but here in the shadow of the Oliver Tambo International airport", "3241": "fortune and glory", "3242": "Thursday", "3243": "Gotti", "3244": "The American photographed the remains of albatross chicks that had died from consuming plastic waste found in the surrounding oceans", "3245": "The report", "3246": "More than 600", "3247": "billionaire businessman and a former center-left president", "3248": "Walger", "3249": "Wood has reportedly been dating a 20-year-old Russian cocktail waitress, Ekaterina Ivanova, for a year.", "3250": "a lot of hydrogen vehicles around", "3251": "industrialized nation", "3252": "200,000", "3253": "old Hollywood", "3254": "help himself.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It was like a weird time-travel, out-of-body type thing,\" Bacon, 53, told PEOPLE. \"It's like if you went and saw the interview you did for your first job.

Luis Fortuno announced the call-up in his annual state of Puerto Rico speech Monday night, saying the help is needed until more officers can be trained. He did not set a timetable.\r\n\r\nIn a separate development, Fortuno announced Tuesday that U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez Velez had reached an agreement with the commonwealth's Justice Department and Puerto Rico Police Department for federal prosecutors to have jurisdiction over a series of major crimes. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States and more stringent federal U.S. laws can apply.\r\n\r\n\"To those who commit carjackings,\" Fortuno said, \"to those who provoke shootouts on our roads ... to sexual offenders who rob our children of our innocence, our message is clear: We're going to impose on them the full weight of the federal law.

This is an additional crime-fighting measure.\"\r\n\r\nBy all measures, there's much crime to fight.\r\n\r\nA 2010 threat assessment by a 15-agency task force notes there were 68,738 violent crimes reported in 2008, a 9.3 percent increase over the previous year. Of the 13 major police areas in Puerto Rico, the municipality of Bayamon was the worst, with 16,590 violent crimes.\r\n\r\nHomicides also showed a significant increase, with 807 killings reported in 2008, the latest year for which statistics were available. That was a 10.5 percent increase over the previous year. Homicides had already increased by 9.2 percent in 2007.\r\n\r\nSan Juan had the highest homicide rate in 2008, with 177 slayings. Bayamon was second-highest, with 154 killings.\r\n\r\nAs in many other parts of the world, authorities tie the crime jump to drugs.\r\n\r\n\"It's strong. It's very strong,\" Rodriguez told CNN.\r\n\r\nA recent Puerto Rico Police Department report documented that more than 60 percent of the slayings on the island were directly related to drug trafficking.\r\n\r\n\"Drug-related violence is endemic in Puerto Rico,\" said a 2009 analysis by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center. \"Homicide rates typically rank among the highest in the United States, and law enforcement officials report that most of these homicides are related to drug trafficking. [Drug-trafficking organizations] and gangs frequently use intimidation, violence and murder to gain and retain control of retail drug markets in the region.\"\r\n\r\nThe largest gangs predominantly operate in public housing projects scattered throughout San Juan, Aguadilla, Fajardo and Ponce, the 15-agency threat assessment said. Drug gangs also operate in lower-income neighborhoods where they feel less vulnerable to law enforcement.\r\n\r\nCocaine, crack-cocaine, marijuana, heroin and Ecstasy are the drugs most widely trafficked, officials say.\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico is particularly vulnerable because of its location.\r\n\r\n\"The Caribbean region remains a major transshipment area for cocaine and heroin shipments originating from Colombia, transiting through Venezuela and destined to the United States, Europe and Canada,\" the multiagency report said.\r\n\r\nThe criminals are well-financed and well-armed.\r\n\r\n\"Large-caliber assault type rifles such as AK-47s, M-16s and various types of military carbines are the weapons of choice,\" the report said. \"In some instances, rifles recovered in the streets have been converted to fire in the fully automatic mode. The handguns of choice are Glocks and Smith & Wesson pistols converted to fire in the fully automatic mode, thus providing added fire power.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Drug Intelligence Center also notes that Puerto Rico \"is a major money-laundering center for drug traffickers operating in the region.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Puerto Rican officials did not mention it this week, there's another reason for the National Guard deployment.\r\n\r\n\"Public confidence in the [Puerto Rico Police Department's] ability to protect the citizenry remains low because of continued corruption within the department,\" the National Drug Intelligence Center analysis said. \"This situation has resulted in decreased cooperation between the public and the police department and has made it more difficult for police officers to deter crime and enforce the law.\r\n\r\n\"Consequently, it is likely that the crime rate", "3516": "the UC Berkeley School of Law", "3517": "JetBlue Airways", "3518": "150 years", "3519": "Saturday.\r\n\r\nU.S. troops speak to an Iraqi child in Baghdad on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division will not replace a North Carolina National Guard unit already in Iraq, Lt.

Gen. Eric Schoomaker, the Army Surgeon General told reporters Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nNot surprisingly, the report showed that soldiers with multiple deployments, three or four tours of duty to Iraq or Afghanistan, had much lower morale and more mental health problems than those soldiers who have one or two combat deployments. Increased time at home, however, resulted in improved morale among troops sent back to the field.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe updated survey of soldiers in Afghanistan found post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in soldiers at the same levels of the survey in 2007, but still about double that of the 2005 survey results: 21.4 percent in 2009, 23.4 percent for 2007 and 10.4 percent in 2005, according to the report.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Iraq, where the survey has been done every year, lower numbers were attributed to the decrease in combat action there. The 2009 numbers showed 13.3 percent of soldiers suffering from mental health problems, compared to 18.8 percent in 2007 and 22 percent in 2006.\r\r\n\r\r\nArmy officials said that with the push of more than 20,000 additional troops into the Afghan theater of battle over the last few months, there have been fewer mental health professionals in the field to help. Army officials said the ration was about one mental health professional for every 1,120 soldiers.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo combat the falling morale and lack of mental health professionals in the field, Army officials said the service needs to more than double the number of mental health providers and hopes to have at least 65 more of those providers in the field by December, making the ratio one for every 700 soldiers.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe mental health assessment teams also conducted interviews with soldiers and found a drop in unit morale in Afghanistan to about half of what it was in 2007 and 2005, when about 10 percent surveyed gave top ratings to unit morale. In 2009, that number was 5.7 percent.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report also showed soldiers are seeing more difficulty at home with an increasing number reporting they are getting or considering getting divorced, according to the report.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe overall report was based on almost 4,000 soldiers who filled out anonymous surveys in Iraq and Afghanistan between December 2008 and June 2009.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Iraq, 2,400 soldiers were randomly selected and the results were studied by a mental health assessment team in the combat zone", "3529": "tears", "3530": "David Roston", "3531": "2 million", "3532": "Tennessee", "3533": "Utah's Logan", "3534": "hijackers", "3535": "hydrogen technology", "3536": "Houston", "3537": "Suu Kyi's lawyer asked the court to open up the hearings but was turned down because of security concerns, Win said.\r\n\r\nPolice put up roadblocks on the streets leading to the Insean Prison near Yangon, with a half-dozen officers at each station.

She is now being held in a specially built area of Insein Prison, where Yettaw also is detained, a U.S. Embassy official told CNN on Friday.\r\n\r\nThe timing of Suu Kyi's detention raised suspicion among her supporters, who said the government's action was an excuse to extend her house arrest.

Those who oppose the junta still use the old name.\r\n\r\nSuu Kyi's lawyer, U Kyi Win, blamed her prison detention on Yettaw.\r\n\r\nLocal media said Yettaw, a 53-year-old former military serviceman from Falcon, Missouri, swam almost two miles across Inya Lake on May 3 and sneaked into Suu Kyi's home. Police maintain a round-the-clock presence outside the house. And swimming in the lake is forbidden.\r\n\r\nU Kyi Win told CNN that Yettaw arrived at his client's house that day and that she asked him to leave immediately. U Kyi Win said Yettaw refused to leave, first saying he didn't want to swim in daylight for fear of being captured, and later blaming leg cramps. Yettaw finally left May 5.\r\n\r\nSuu Kyi didn't tell authorities about the visit because she didn't want Yettaw or anyone else to get in trouble, Win said, nothing that several of her party members and supporters are already in jail. He added that Yettaw would likely be in the courtroom during the trial.\r\n\r\nLittle else is known about Yettaw's role in the Myanmar incident or his intentions, apart from local media reports that said Yettaw, a diabetic, told Suu Kyi's two housekeepers he was tired and hungry after the swim and they offered him food.\r\n\r\nSome previous media reports referred to him as John William Yeattaw. He appeared healthy and in good spirits at a hearing on Friday at Insein Prison, the U.S. Embassy official said.\r\n\r\nThe defense will argue that Yettaw entered Suu Kyi's home due to poor government security, said Jared Genser, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who is one of the attorneys on her defense team.\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, she does not believe she did any offense,\" Genser said.\r\n\r\nHe noted that Insein Prison houses many political prisoners, and the conditions are poor for even a young, healthy person. Tuberculosis is rampant, mosquitoes and other insects are numerous, and nighttime temperatures at the prison frequently reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit (29-32 Celsius) with no fresh air traveling through the facility, Genser said.\r\n\r\n\"There is deep reason to be concerned with her detention,\" he said. \"Insein is a notorious prison.

They returned to the plant about eight and a half hours later, and no fresh damage to the facility had been reported Friday afternoon, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the quake, engineers had been injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the No. 1 reactor containment shell to counter a buildup of hydrogen in the chamber. That process continued while the plant was evacuated, and so did the pumping of fresh water into that reactor and units 2 and 3, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.\r\r\n\r\r\nHydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors, which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami.

And the way she's done it? It's largely through the fashion choices she's made.\r\n\r\nEach of her predecessors has brought a unique perspective and personality to the east wing of the White House, helping to shape how the nation views the president and how the world views the nation.\r\n\r\nThe use of fashion and image as a political strategy is an underrated factor. While Washington's political cognoscenti debate the successes and failures of the young Obama presidency, one half of Washington's newest power couple fine tunes fashion as a political strategy -- and it's working for her.  See photos of Michelle Obama's fashion \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe fashion authorities who are gathered this week in New York for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, more than seven months into the Obama presidency, are watching Michelle Obama's redefinition of the role of first lady with professional and personal interest.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary standard for the job was set decades ago by Jacqueline Kennedy, who had both a high sense of fashion and the style to pull it off. Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the historian at the National First Ladies' Library, points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed, liked European style and had American designers copy it. She even went as far as to personally design her own outfits on three important state occasions, including her famous White House dinner for Nobel laureates, while letting other designers take the credit.\r\n\r\nThe comparisons between Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Obama are as apt as the comparisons between their husbands. Michelle Obama comes across as feminine yet strong, professional and, unlike Mrs. Kennedy, approachable. She's a thoughtful presence on the national stage, but it's a very different kind of style from what we associate with Jackie Kennedy, who displayed a style of wealth, youth and glamor to an adoring middle class.\r\n\r\nMrs. Obama, on the other hand, is portrayed as a take-charge woman who is sensitive to today's economic realities. Not stylish in her own right, she blends advice from her noted advisers to appear independent and progressive, yet \"in touch.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Jackie was high fashion, Michelle Obama is trendy but traditional. And that approachability extends to her personal style as well, her advisors having absorbed the lesson that the first lady's style is all too easily linked to her husband's presidency. Ronald Reagan's opponents used his wife Nancy's interest in fashion and her intent to look like the wife of a president, rather than mimic the school-marmish attire of her predecessor, as a gateway through which to attack the president.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reagan's wardrobe choices, especially her designer Adolfo dresses, were used to make her husband seem insensitive to the poor and hungry. Mrs. Obama has avoided making the same mistake during the worst economic times in recent memory.\r\n\r\nShe seems to have made a calculated decision to avoid that trap by focusing on emerging designers, like Jason Wu for her inaugural gown or choosing to wear trendy, off-the-rack clothes like the J. Crew gloves, sweater and skirt she chose for her husband's inauguration.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever the style mavens have to say about that, it produces political benefits. J. Crew's shares jumped 10 percent within 24 hours after the nation saw her in its clothing, which prompted NBC's Conan O'Brien to suggest the president consider wearing a Buick.\r\n\r\nAs Women's Wear Daily media reporter Stephanie Smith says, this child of Chicago's South Side has become \"the biggest celebrity in the world.\" Forbes lists her among the \"Most Powerful Women,\" and there's no doubt she's expanding the boundaries of perceptions surrounding the role of a \"traditional\" first lady, balancing her visits to homeless shelters and military bases with taking part in her children's soccer games.\r\n\r\nAs The New York Times reported, Mrs. Obama \"pointedly controlled her look on the covers of People, Essence, More and O, Oprah Winfrey's magazine. Editors at Essence, who suggested colors, styles and accessories, said her staff did not call to acknowledge their overtures. ... Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor-in-chief of More... said Mrs. Obama refused to wear anything other than her own clothes for their October cover. 'She wanted none of that. She was creating the cover. She was creating the image. There's definitely a will of steel there.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Anthony, the general public's fascination with Michelle Obama spills over and helps the administration. To him, everything the media and the public criticize or praise is visual. \"It's not anything she's saying or doing. That's perhaps somewhat tactical. If she's unpopular based on her clothes choices, the White House can say it's really not of importance.\"\r\n\r\nIMG executive Fern Mallis, the creative inspiration behind New York's Fashion Week, says \"most first ladies have always been on a pedestal of expensive, elegant clothing, of couture evening gowns. It's something that people can't really relate to.\" This was especially true during the Kennedy years. Even if most American women wanted Jackie's dresses, Anthony points out, they could not buy them. These clothes were not only too expensive -- they weren't even available at the high-end stores. They were one of a kind.\r\n\r\nMrs. Obama, because she has made fashion \"more democratic,\" says style expert Robert Verdi, has made her own impact on a world full of elites and -- let's face it -- snobs. Mrs. Kennedy, he says, \"was very contemporary and up-to-the-moment in fashion. But fashion at that time as not democratic. There was no Zara, no J. Crew, no Banana Republic. It was not accessible; it was exclusively aspirational.\"\r\n\r\nOn balance, though, Michelle Obama has shown a feminine but bold approach", "3593": "Sunday afternoon", "3594": "Monday", "3595": "cut through red tape", "3596": "U.N. invesitgator Phillip Alston", "3597": "no fresh damage", "3598": "Perlitz", "3599": "organs donated by smokers", "3600": "research group", "3601": "all the occupation forces: army, intelligence, militias, and security companies and others", "3602": "brutal campaign", "3603": "British throne", "3604": "Two", "3605": "Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou", "3606": "Salvator Mundi", "3607": "150", "3608": "Edo", "3609": "Skimmed credit card numbers and other personal-identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on Web sites, Fraser said. \"When police shut these Web sites down, they just mushroom up some other place,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAlthough the techniques of cyber crime have evolved, online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages. In the digital age, that means tempting with free downloads, money schemes and pornography.\r\n\r\nThe range of tools used by cyber criminals reveals the quick evolution of the industry. Viruses -- the first generation of the computer culprits -- are used for the computer equivalent of vandalism, as the malicious programs replicate, spread and damage computers.\r\n\r\n\"When the company was set up, we were seeing two or three new viruses a week,\" said Mahendra Negi, chief financial officer of Tokyo-based antivirus maker Trend Micro. \"Now there's a new one every two-and-a-half seconds.\r\n\r\n\"With the arrival of spam in 2001 and 2002, the big difference was it was commercial malware,\" Negi said. \"Once money became involved, the level of sophistication raised a hundred-fold.\"\r\n\r\nNow the biggest threats include \"phishing\" schemes and \"botnet\" attacks.\r\n\r\nPhishing is where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or Web site and trick victims into revealing passwords, credit card information and other personal data.\r\n\r\nBotnet attackers commandeer personal computers as part of a large network of \"zombie\" computers that, on command, target companies for spam attacks to cripple IT capabilities. Botnets -- some of which are large enough to deploy tens of billions of spam e-mails a day -- are often used in extortion schemes.\r\n\r\n\"They ring up the IT manager of a company and say, 'Pay us a million or we'll take you down',\" said Fraser, who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks.\r\n\r\nCompanies often pay up and shut up, computer experts say, rather than report the crime and garner publicity that may hurt their corporate reputation.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike prankster virus-makers, these malware makers are determined to stay hidden.\r\n\r\n\"Once it became a business, then (cyber criminals) began to look at what companies like us were doing, and figure out weaknesses,\" he said. \"They are very customer friendly ... they sell updates, they will highlight", "3610": "the United Nations Security Council", "3611": "Dragonball: Evolution,\" and, for a handful of markets, there's \"Anvil!: The Story of Anvil,\" about an '80s metal band that never grasped the brass ring but whose history certainly makes for entertaining watching.

Those surveyed cited issues like a focus on speed and loss of accuracy as possible issues that could arise with journalism on the Web.\r\n\r\nBut with those concerns, Mitchell said, comes the opportunity to tell stories in a multidimensional way.\r\n\r\n\"We see some tremendous reporting that could not exist in former modes of communication,\" she said, observing that media platforms such as text, photo galleries and video can not only be connected but be used to connect journalists to Internet users and Internet users to each other.\r\n\r\n\"Those are tremendous changes,\" she said.\r\n\r\nRobert M. Steele, the Eugene S. Pulliam Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism at DePauw University in Indiana, said the core values of accuracy and fairness have to be honored, no matter the method of reporting.\r\n\r\nStill, Steele said, further opening the Pulitzer Prizes to online publications \"gives further weight to the role that digital journalism plays in this era.\"\r\n\r\n\"In some ways, it's increased legitimacy for new forms of delivering journalism,\" Steele said. \"It also heightens the discussion about the distinction between basic information and substantive journalism. Just because somebody throws something online doesn't mean it is journalism.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Plotz, editor of Slate, said his site did not apply for the Pulitzers despite what he believes was his publication's exceptional political, technology and business coverage.\r\n\r\n\"We are not a hard-news site, and we don't do the kinds of stories and projects that have traditionally been awarded,\" Plotz said.\r\n\r\nPlotz said the recognition for online journalism is more than warranted.\r\n\r\n\"It's an overdue acknowledgement that some of the best journalism in the world and in America is being created not for print publication but for places that live entirely on the Web,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"There's so much of it that doesn't ever get into a print publication and yet is as important to shaping the debate and to changing how people think about things as to anything you might read in one of our great newspapers or magazines.\"\r\n\r\nPulitzer Prizes for journalism", "3636": "She and soundman Kit Swartz", "3637": "the Madrid commuter train bombings", "3638": "nod", "3639": "richer", "3640": "4 a.m.", "3641": "Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II in the movie.\r\n\r\nPraising director Zack Snyder", "3642": "Alain", "3643": "about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified", "3644": "Thom Filicia Style", "3645": "World War I", "3646": "the capital Seoul", "3647": "wasteful", "3648": "social networking site; the largest, \"I love college", "3649": "first cellular novelist", "3650": "HANNOVER, Germany -- Germany", "3651": "poor", "3652": "three", "3653": "depression", "3654": "the unseeded Kirilenko, who put out former champion Maria Sharapova", "3655": "Bandar", "3656": "Sunday morning", "3657": "300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding", "3658": "the extent of student rights", "3659": "Friendfield Plantation", "3660": "lung cancer", "3661": "Istanbul's stunning skyline: the metallic, mirrored dome of the new Sakirin Mosque, a Muslim place of worship built with a woman's touch.\r\n\r\nWhen sun reflects off Sakirin Mosque's dome, light can be seen across the Bosphorus Strait.\r\n\r\nFor what may be the first time in history, women have been at the forefront of the construction of a mosque in Turkey.\r\n\r\nOne of the project's leaders is Zeynep Fadillioglu, an interior decorator who has designed restaurants, hotels and luxury homes from New Delhi, India, to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and London, England.\r\n\r\nShe helped organize a team of traditional mosque artists specializing in Islamic calligraphy, along with craftsmen in glassworks, metal-casting and lighting who, like Fadillioglu, have built careers working in exclusively secular architecture and design.\r\n\r\n\"I want people to feel peaceful and be left with themselves as much as possible and yet have beautiful art and artistic symbolism around them,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIstanbul has a venerable tradition of mosque architecture, dating back centuries to when Ottoman sultans declared themselves caliph, or spiritual leader of the Muslim world.

But Istanbul's most senior Muslim cleric laments that mosque design suffered a decline after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I.\r\n\r\n\"In the last 70, 80 years, we have built mosques that are copies of Ottoman architecture,\" said Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul. \"This wasn't a good development, because the copy can never be as good as the original.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu and her team of artists are hoping to change that.  Look at photos of the mosque \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe Sakirin Mosque was commissioned by a wealthy Turkish Arab family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe designers put a number of contemporary touches on the structure, giving it plate glass walls etched with gold-leaf verses from the Quran, framed by giant cast-iron grids.\r\n\r\nThe mihrab -- the alcove that points worshippers in the direction of Mecca -- is made of asymmetrical ovals, similar to a design used by Fadillioglu to decorate a restaurant in London. And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops.\r\n\r\n\"The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,\" Fadillioglu explained. \"So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the artists here never worked on a mosque before.\r\n\r\n\"It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,\" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. \"If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area. Sort of as if (they are) unwanted in the mosque,\" she said. \"That is not what Islam is about. ...

They have to pray in a small women's section, hidden behind a bank of chest-high shelves that store shoes.\r\n\r\nAt the Sakirin Mosque, Fadillioglu said, she gave women praying on the balcony an unobstructed view of the dome, the ornate chandelier, and the area on the floor", "3662": "Tropical Storm Noel", "3663": "second", "3664": "Philadelphia", "3665": "A Scouts spokesman said that, in recent years, the organization", "3666": "The View", "3667": "Heath Ledger's dark and disturbing portrayal of the Joker.

When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre, severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat, and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed. It was flying the flag of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain, Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement  -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory.\r\n\r\nAlso on board was former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney.\r\n\r\nPenhaul said an Israeli patrol boat shined its spotlight on the Dignity, and then it and another patrol boat shadowed the Dignity for about a half hour before the collision.\r\n\r\nOne patrol boat \"very severely rammed\" the Dignity, Penhaul said.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning. Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities, the captain said.\r\n\r\nBut Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area.\r\n\r\nPalmor said there was no response to the radio message, and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat, leading to the collision.  Watch Penhaul describe the boat damage \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally, Penhaul said, but Palmor called those allegations \"absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody,\" Palmor said.\r\n\r\n\"I would call it ramming. Let's just call it as it is,\" McKinney said after the boat docked in Lebanon. \"Our boat was rammed three times, twice in the front and one on the side.  Watch Cynthia McKinney discuss the collision \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in international waters about 90 miles off Gaza. Israel controls the waters off Gaza's coast and routinely blocks ships from coming into the Palestinian territory as part of an ongoing blockade that also applies to the Israel-Gaza border. Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza, which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies.\r\n\r\nTuesday's collision was so severe, Penhaul said, that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats. The Dignity began taking on water, but the crew managed to pump it out of the hull long enough for the boat to reach shore.\r\n\r\n\"It could have ended with people drowning if they hit us more square on,\" Dignity's captain, Denis Healey, said. \"It could have gone down in minutes.\"\r\n\r\nPalmor said the vessel refused assistance after the incident.\r\n\r\nThe boat was carrying boxes of relief supplies, volunteers and journalists to Gaza, the Palestinian territory that has been subject to an intense Israeli bombing campaign since Saturday.\r\n\r\nIsrael Tuesday lambasted McKinney -- the Green Party's 2008 candidate for the U.S. presidency and a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia -- for taking part in the maritime mission.\r\n\r\nIn a written statement, the Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast, based in Atlanta, Georgia, said McKinney \"has taken it upon herself to commit an act of provocation,\" endangering herself and the crew.\r\n\r\n\"We regret that during this time of crisis, while Israel is battling with the terrorist organization of Hamas and defending its citizens, that we are forced to deal with Ms. McKinney's irresponsible behavior,\" the statement read.\r\n\r\nThe trip was the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement's sixth in as many months.\r\n\r\nIsrael launched airstrikes against Gaza on Saturday in what Defense Minister Ehud Barak called an \"all-out war\" against the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007.

Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut now the FIA is in possession of new evidence. Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso. On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa, Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated: \"The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession, or that such drivers have recently been in possession, of written evidence relevant to this investigation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe letter continued: \"I can confirm, given the importance of this issue, that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the International Sporting Code or the Formula One regulations. However, in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information, serious consequences could follow.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFive days later the WMSC announced it was to reconvene \"following the emergence of new evidence\", in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa in practice leading up to the Monaco Grand Prix. Stepney has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther drama overshadowed Alonso and Hamilton's one-two on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. Modena's public prosecutor, Giuseppe Tibis, issued a legal notice -- known as an 'avviso di garanzia' -- that six McLaren employees were under criminal investigation . The six included McLaren supremo Ron Dennis, managing directors Martin Whitmarsh and Jonathan Neale, technical director Jonathan Neale and designer Rob Taylor as well as Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis outcome has put a dark shadow McLaren's return to winning ways.

Nujood is angry, combative and yelling. Tension surrounds the home like a noose.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter much arguing with family members, Nujood  finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with CNN. Her presence is grudging, although CNN got advance permission to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was faring.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago. Then, there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child, a portrait of innocence. She had a shy smile, playful nature and a whimsical giggle.\r\r\n\r\r\nHer retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting.  Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World's Untold Stories \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nThe story was supposed to end with the divorce. There was, though, a stunning transformation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph. Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the fall of 2008, Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year, alongside some of the world's most impressive women. She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere is a tell-all book, which is to be published in more than 20 languages, and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's strength was celebrated by complete strangers. But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform?\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There is no change at all since going on television,\" Nujood says bitterly. \"I hoped there was someone to help us, but we didn't find anyone. It hasn't changed a thing. They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me. I wish I had never spoken to the media.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere was never going to be a fortune. Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school, but she refuses to attend, according to Shada Nasser, the human rights lawyer who took on the child's divorce case.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I know Nujood was absent from the school. I spoke with her father and her family. And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school. But they said, 'You know we don't have the money for the transportation. Don't have the money for the food,' \" says Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents say they've received nothing, and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I was happy I got divorced but I'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television,\" she said, adding that she feels like an outcast even among  family and friends.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly. And yet, as a wife, she was spared nothing.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I didn't want to sleep with him but he forced me to, he hit me, insulted me,\" she said. She described being married and living as a wife at such a young age as sheer torture.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood described how she was beaten and raped and how, after just a few weeks of marriage, she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement. But her parents told her they could not protect her, that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate.\r\r\n\r\r\nCNN tried to get comment from the girl's ex-husband and family, but they declined.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents, like many others in Yemen, struck a social bargain. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18, many times to older men, some with more than one wife.\r\r\n\r\r\nMarriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. But Nujood's parents say they did not expect the girl's new husband to demand sex from his child bride.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter several hours, a judge finally went to see her. \"And he asked me, 'what do you want' and I said 'I want a divorce' and he said 'you're married?' And I said 'yes.'\" says Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing, and the girl was put in the care of Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with her that she should get her divorce.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut based on the principles of Shariah law, her husband was compensated, not prosecuted. Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day.\r\r\n\r\r\nKhadije Al Salame is working to help the girl get her life back. Now a Yemeni diplomat, she too was a child bride 30 years ago. But when she left her husband, she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe said: \"It's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out, but the problem is it's too much pressure on her.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"She doesn't understand what's going on. She's a little girl and we have to understand as media people that we should leave her alone now.

We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year.\r\n\r\nWe need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ... But without that kind of family support, then we need Boys and Girls Clubs. We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We need mentors. Otherwise, these kids will find bad adults to copy from, and we're going to lose them.\r\n\r\nLemon: I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me.\r\n\r\nLemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort?\r\n\r\nPowell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe've got to teach them that you've got to behave.

It won a prize and soon publishers approached him, asking if he wanted to turn his digital book into a paper one. By early 2008, his novel \"First Experience,\" a story about love and sex in high school, was a top title in one of Tokyo's biggest bookstores.\r\n\r\nSince it emerged in Japan nearly a decade ago, the cell phone novel, or keitai shosetsu, has moved from a little-known subgenre to a mainstream literary phenomenon. Keitai shosetsu sites boast billions of monthly users while publishers sell millions of copies of cellular stories taken from phones and turned into paperback.\r\n\r\nIt is even spreading to other countries as other cultures start to take part in a type of composition long considered purely Japanese.\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests, cell phone novels are written entirely on handsets and posted on sites like Maho no i-rando (Magic Island), the first and largest mobile novel portal in Japan. The site has a million titles, 3.5 billion monthly visitors and six million registered users, according to the company. Mobile readers instantly see new chapters as they are added, often adding comments about the direction they think a novel should take.\r\n\r\nThe diary-like stories are written and read mostly by young women in their teens and 20's. Many authors use pen names and claim their stories are at least partially autobiographical. The novels often center on themes that are rarely discussed aloud in Japanese society -- drugs, sex, pregnancy, abortion, rape and disease.\r\n\r\n\"When they write those novels, they share their secret, personal problems, and when they read by mobile phones, they can hide what they are reading,\" explained Toshie Takahashi, an associate professor of media studies at Rikkyo University in Tokyo.\r\n\r\n\"They are also involved and engaged with their mobile phones very strongly,\" added Takahashi, noting that 96 percent of high school students own a cell phone in Japan.\r\n\r\n\"The mobile phone itself is embedded in young people's everyday lives very deeply and also emotionally and physically.\"\r\n\r\nDespite its popularity among young women, a male writer known as Yoshi, widely considered the first cellular novelist, brought the burgeoning genre to light when he self-published \"Deep Love\" in 2002. The story about a prostitute in Tokyo sold nearly 3 million copies and was adapted for film, television and Manga, or Japanese comics.\r\n\r\nPublishing phenomenon\r\n\r\nA struggling Japanese publishing industry was quick to take notice of the growing popularity of keitai shosetsu, especially early works like Yoshi's \"Deep Love.\" Many of the popular cell phone novels have since been turned into paperbacks, and bookstores across Japan now have entire sections devoted to the digital-age literary genre.\r\n\r\nBy 2007, half of the country's 10 best-selling novels were written on cell phones, according to book distributor Tohan while last year mobile novels and comics were a $240 million market in Japan, which is over 5 percent of the country's $4.5 billion total mobile content market, according to Japan's Mobile Content Forum.\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, three Japanese mobile phone novel publishers reported collective sales of 1.7 million copies. Publishers, like Goma Books, one of the first to print cell phone novels, have also launched their own keitai shosetsu sites, which they use to sift through for talent whose work will be marketable on bookshelves.\r\n\r\nGoma's mobile story site Orion carries 20,000 novels and has approximately two million monthly users, according to the company. Goma has also published several top-selling keitai shosetsu, including \"The Red Thread,\" by Mei (also a pen name).\r\n\r\nSince it was released in 2007, the story, which revolves around the romance of two middle school students, has sold nearly 2 million copies and was adapted for a TV series and movie last December.

A spokeswoman for Maersk Line Limited did not immediately return a call from CNN seeking comment.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Maersk Alabama was hijacked by pirates April 8. Hicks, working as chief steward and preparing food for other crew members, heard over the loudspeaker that pirates were on board, and he and other crew members gathered in the ship's engine room for nearly 12 hours, according to a news release from Bryant.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The engine room was dark and hot, maybe 130 degrees,\" Hicks said in the news release. \"We were all cramping up with heat stroke symptoms when we were able to take a pirate hostage and tried to negotiate the return of our captain.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe pirates promised to exchange Capt. Richard Phillips for the pirate hostage, but reneged on that agreement, the news release.\r\r\n\r\r\nPhillips offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the freedom of his crew.

See photos of Longboat Key's beaches, birds and sunsets \u00bb\r\n\r\nTell people you are heading to Longboat Key, and many will think it's part of the Florida Keys off the southern tip of the state, but LBK is about 200 miles to the north-northwest of -- and in some ways worlds away from -- Key West and its neighbors.\r\n\r\nNightlife on the island is likely to mean a moonlit walk on the beach rather than a drink at the bar, and the odds are good the locals will sport gray hair.\r\n\r\nElegant setting\r\n\r\nBuffered by Sarasota Bay on one side and facing the Gulf of Mexico on the other, the Key is sheltered from the tourist hustle and bustle of mainland Florida.\r\n\r\nAt less than 11 miles in length and no more than a mile across in its widest places, LBK also feels like a secluded community with an elegant flavor of its own.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings are lush, upscale and serene. A trip down Gulf of Mexico Drive, the island's main artery, reveals golf courses, condominiums and homes ranging from newly constructed mansions to older, one-story houses.\r\n\r\nThe traffic is light, life moves at a slower pace and the mood is relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"You won't find mini-malls, towering billboards, or glaring neon signs,\" the local Chamber of Commerce promises.\r\n\r\nNonhuman island visitors also contribute to the mellow atmosphere. Dolphins regularly swim just offshore. Great egrets and great blue herons fish along the beach, while pelicans dive into the water in search of a meal. Birds of all sizes regularly patrol the palm-lined parking lot of the local supermarket looking for scraps of food from the lunch crowd.\r\n\r\nWingless creatures also pop up in unexpected places. Visitors walking into one establishment are greeted by a stern voice exclaiming, \"Bear, no!\" Bear, it turns out, is a curious 5-month old Chesapeake Bay retriever who insists on checking out all the customers entering the store despite his owner's orders to stay put.\r\n\r\nLodging and shopping\r\n\r\nThere are few hotels on Longboat Key, but rental homes and condos abound, so it's best to make lodging arrangements in advance, especially for visitors who plan to stay a while. Low season generally starts in May and runs until November.\r\n\r\nTourists yearning to make the island a permanent home should bring along a big wallet. The average sale price for a condominium was more than $1 million last year, and it topped $1.5 million for a single-family home, according to the local Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nSpenders on a smaller scale can get their fix in neighboring St. Armands Key", "4333": "Thursday", "4334": "X-Men Origins: Wolverine (No. 2)", "4335": "Myanmar's military junta", "4336": "nearly 41 feet", "4337": "10th", "4338": "The unauthorized release of a domestic violence photograph immediately generated an internal investigation", "4339": "1,200", "4340": "dismissed the espionage allegations", "4341": "Larry Langford", "4342": "AT&T", "4343": "Rolling Stones", "4344": "an SLA plot", "4345": "worse", "4346": "Nuri al-Maliki", "4347": "risk", "4348": "Sunday", "4349": "Botswana", "4350": "Atlas of the Real World", "4351": "Michigan", "4352": "reality TV show", "4353": "the penalties", "4354": "Friday", "4355": "paralyzed from the neck down after a car accident", "4356": "Jim Morrison.\r\n\r\nOfficials won't say  where Michael Jackson was buried, but family gathered at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.\r\n\r\nTheir graves are public shrines for fans and followers. Countless people from all over the world make pilgrimages to their burial sites, hoping to draw close to those they adored from afar.\r\n\r\nNow Michael Jackson's gravesite will become the next holy grail.\r\n\r\nA private gathering for the pop icon was held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California. Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where.\r\n\r\nOfficials at Forest Lawn won't disclose where Jackson's body is being buried. If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months.\r\n\r\nThere has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch.\r\n\r\nIf a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite.\r\n\r\n\"If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,\" said Steve Goldstein, author of L.A.'s Gravesite Companion: Where the VIP's RIP. \"He'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over Marilyn.\"\r\n\r\nFame follows celebrities in life and in death.\r\n\r\n\"There's always a fascination with celebrities, but it's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses,\" says Jim Tipton, founder of findagrave.com, a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens. \"But once they are interred into the ground, anyone who wants to go can go.\"\r\n\r\nTipton's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago, when he saw mobster Al Capone's grave in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. He and many others who are avid about visiting celebrity and historical graves dub themselves \"grave hunters.\"\r\n\r\nThey seek the dead for various reasons. Some go out of simple curiosity. Others are history lovers. Many are fans who deeply admired the stars. Some say they feel a connection to the celebrities by standing beside their graves.\r\n\r\nAt Elvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, guests visiting the grave can stay at the retro Heartbreak Hotel and visit the museum to learn more about the King of Rock and Roll.\r\n\r\nWestwood Memorial Park and Cemetery in Los Angeles houses Hollywood notables including sex symbol Marilyn Monroe and comic Rodney Dangerfield.  The most recent celebrity to be buried there is actress Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer last month. Visitors can access the cemetery easily, and even tour buses drop by.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a product of that era, of Charlie's Angels,\" said Jayne Osborne, a self-proclaimed grave hunter who visited Fawcett's grave a week ago. The 48-year-old education administrator began searching for celebrity graves in the early 1970s. Since then, she's visited hundreds of celebrity resting places in Southern California. \"I wanted to pay my respect.\"\r\n\r\nAt Westwood, the most popular grave site remains Monroe's. Fans often decorate her grave with flowers and cards. Her headstone is slightly darker than the others from so many fans touching it, grave hunters say.\r\n\r\nIn P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the largest cemetery in Paris, France, American singer Jim Morrison's grave is tattooed with graffiti and artwork. Morrison fans like to leave candles, poems and gifts as tokens of appreciation.\r\n\r\nAt one point, fans were so rowdy that a stone block was put in place in an attempt to seal the grave from fans trying to unearth it. After unsuccessful attempts by French authorities to move the tomb to another site, security officers were placed at the grave.\r\n\r\nSimilar trouble plagued Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia, where members of the Allman Brothers Band were buried in the early 1970s. Thousands of fans journeyed to visit the graves and party there, leaving behind cigarette butts and empty alcohol bottles. Relatives fought to have an iron fence erected around the graves.\r\n\r\nSome celebrity graves prove tempting to visitors, like that of heartthrob actor James Dean. His headstone in a public cemetery in Fairmount, Indiana, has been stolen twice.\r\n\r\nForest Lawn Memorial Park remains one of the most exclusive Hollywood burial sites. The staff is tight lipped, refusing to release the whereabouts of anyone buried there, except to family members.

Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service.\r\n\r\nShe sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29.

I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped?

He said it is political party function, with most of the attendees being ZANU-PF elite. As the prime minister, Tsvangirai is not obligated to attend, the spokesman said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe spokesman would not acknowledge whether Tsvangirai had initially agreed to attend, but it was widely reported in Zimbabwean media that he had agreed to do so.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,\" said Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change.\r\r\n\r\r\nTsvangirai last year said Mugabe's birthday party was \"a gathering of the satisfied few.\" But at that point, he and the president were preparing to face off in a hotly contested presidential election.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs Saturday's celebrations began in a carnival atmosphere, just less than a kilometer (0.62 miles) away stood a deserted Chinhoyi government hospital -- a reflection of the country's dire health situation.

Could you tell us more about what challenges you had to overcome to bring Biocon to a global level? Vishala Vasandani\r\n\r\nMazumdar Shaw: My journey started 30 years ago at a time when I had to face credibility challenges that pertained to my gender, my inexperience as a business entrepreneur and my unfamiliar biotechnology-based business model. My business evolved in tandem with challenges.\r\n\r\nOnce I overcame these credibility challenges, I faced technological challenges of trying to build a Biotech business in a country that had infrastructure that was too primitive to support a high tech industry that demanded uninterrupted power supply, high quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, advanced scientific skills etc.\r\n\r\nOver the next 10 years, we systematically addressed these challenges and built a self contained enterprise that had captive power and water supply, state of the art labs and facilities and a team of highly experienced scientists and engineers capable of delivering world class research and technologies.\r\n\r\nToday, our challenges address those posed by new medical wisdom: addressing unmet medical needs, researching new drugs, new drug delivery systems and new therapies. Overcoming each of these phases has been a rich learning experience that has helped us to develop world class expertise in biotechnology. Innovation and quality have been integral to our business ethos.\r\n\r\nCan Biocon's oral insulin IN-105 replace traditional and painful needle based insulin delivery system for type1 diabetics? Can a diabetic who is taking insulin by needle based delivery system hope for change in near future?  Ajay Kumar Singh\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: Oral Insulin is not just about delivering Insulin in a tablet. It is about delivering Insulin very rapidly to the liver (hepato-delivery) which is the main organ responsible for glycemic control in our body. Injectable Insulin takes approximately 30 minutes to act. Oral Insulin takes approximately 5 minutes to act which mimics how non-diabetics respond to glucose uptake when food is consumed. This will help both Type I and Type II diabetics to manage their diabetes better.\r\n\r\nWe hope that early intervention with Oral Insulin will help to manage Diabetes especially in Type II diabetics much more effectively than is being done by oral diabetic agents like Metformin, Sulphonyl Ureas and Glitazones which stimulate the pancreas to produce Insulin.\r\n\r\nThis is unlike oral Insulin which will allow a poorly functioning pancreas to rest and hopefully help to revive Insulin secreting beta cells. Should our Oral Insulin program succeed, this will revolutionize Diabetes therapy in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you had to do the IPO again what would you do differently and when can we see Biocon listed in NASDAQ?  Harish Swaminathan\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I don't believe so. I think we got the valuation we were expecting through an Indian listing. A NASDAQ listing is only something we will address when one of our branded drugs are close to commercialization in either the U.S. or European markets. Today NASDAQ is risk averse and not valuing biotech companies any better than the BSE or NSE.\r\n\r\nI am so humbled by your story. What does it take as a woman to get to where you are today? What obstacles did you have to overcome, especially in an industry that is deemed to be a \"man's world\"? Would women setting up business in India today find it easier than you did? Irene Gonza, Uganda\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I believe that women need to believe in themselves. I set up Biocon with a spirit of challenge and a deep sense of purpose. The challenge was to break the gender bias in the business world.\r\n\r\nMy sense of purpose was to create a Biotech business in a country like India which had a very poor research culture with limited opportunities for scientists and engineers to pursue a career. It was about stopping the \"brain drain\" from India. It was about providing exciting career opportunities to young scientists and engineers. It was about encouraging young women to pursue careers.\r\n\r\nWhen one is passionate about a mission that is about change, it enables you to persevere and endure. I do believe that if I could achieve success, any woman can overcome obstacles with a sense of determination!\r\n\r\nWhen you set up Biocon did you aim to make it one of the biggest and most successful in the world? Do you need ambition like that be a success in any kind of business or does it take luck, too?  David James, London\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: When I set up Biocon, I certainly did not have such a big ambition! I basically wanted to run a successful and profitable business to start with. Ambition is evolutionary and one does not see the big picture until you reach a certain critical mass. It was only a few years ago that we developed a global ambition and built global scale in our operations.\r\n\r\nWhilst luck can be described as \"being at the right place at the right time\" or \"being prepared to address an opportunity,\" I personally believe that it is about being able to seize opportunities by leveraging existing capabilities to reach new levels. In our case, we leveraged our enzyme capabilities to pursue bio-pharmaceuticals; it was also about picking the right products (statins & Insulin) that had large markets.\r\n\r\nWe chose to partner with innovative companies and in-license innovative technologies which spearheaded our new drug development programs. We have always chosen to differentiate ourselves from the market and this has allowed us to \"think out of the box\" and stand apart.\r\n\r\nHow do you think the global economic downturn will affect Biocon and Indian companies in general?  Alicia van Waveren, The Hague\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: The economic meltdown will certainly bring tremendous pricing pressure and we expect to see our margins shrink. We also expect payment terms that involve extended credits. However, we also see a silver lining amidst this gloomy scenario as R&D and manufacturing are likely to shift to countries like India in order to bring down costs.\r\n\r\nWe have two subsidiaries that offer research and clinical services, Syngene and Clinigene that are likely to see their businesses increase. We also expect generic drugs to become a larger part of healthcare budgets in western economies.\r\n\r\nFinally, new drug development costs are under tremendous pressure both in terms of funding and development. India and companies like Biocon provide very effective co-development partnership opportunities to bring these costs down. The differences between wealth and poverty in India are starker than anywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nDo you think the poverty gap will ever be closed?  Richard Ng, Hong Kong\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: Poverty poses a huge challenge. Education and employment are the only answers.\r\n\r\nIndia is striving to address these two areas through various education and vocational training initiatives. What we also need is employment generation through a myriad of projects that span infrastructure development, co-operative agriculture to entrepreneurship. India needs to provide rural connectivity both in terms of roads and tale/IT connectivity. This will unleash inclusive growth in a huge way.\r\n\r\nToday we are caught between a political ethos that finds it convenient to keep its vote bank ignorant and unemployed and a civic India that wants to educate and harness the potential of its human capital.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Indian biotech and pharmaceutical industry is relying more on being the outsourced resource of the U.S. and EU companies rather than creating their own intellectual property.Do you think this a culture in India to not be active in creating IP or is it related to the inadequacies in the patent law?  Dipanjan Nag\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: A very correct observation. The risks associated with proprietary products are high and Indian businesses and more importantly Indian investors and banks are extremely risk averse. Hopefully, the rapid commoditization of generics and services will force companies to differentiate on the basis of IP.\r\n\r\nAt Biocon we strongly believe that our proprietary programs will help us sustain growth in the future. It is a challenge to convince our investors of this but we think they will understand this in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, what is the one piece of advice you wish you'd been given when you were starting out in business?  Karl Malone, Winchester\r\n\r\nRisk is not about taking but about managing. I took a huge risk when I started a Biotech company in 1978 and I soon realized that I had to manage the risk by addressing very serious challenges of a very primitive infrastructure at the time. It took me a lot longer than I thought to build the company but in hindsight it was still worth the effort!\r\n\r\nWhat drives you to achieve what you have and to keep going when times are tough?  Melinda Cook, Melbourne\r\n\r\nThe belief that we can deliver the world's first Oral Insulin and other life saving drugs for cancer and auto-immune diseases. I am driven by my desire to see novel drugs being developed by Biocon for global markets with a \"Made in India\" label.\r\n\r\nI am determined to see India earn a strong reputation in innovation. At a time when most Biotech companies in the western world are challenged with funding, I believe we can forge ahead and succeed.\r\n\r\nAbout Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw is founder of Biocon, the biotech and pharmaceutical company that made her India's richest self-made businesswoman.\r\n\r\nShe was named as one of Fortune magazine's 50 Most Powerful Women in 2007 and was instrumental in forging India's biotechnology industry.\r\n\r\nLiving and working in Bangalore, she set up Biocon in 1978 and has developed it into a global biopharmaceutical player with highly developed research and development facilities focusing on cancer and diabetes treatments.\r\n\r\nBiocon was bought first by Unilever in 1989 and then sold to ICI in 1997, but Mazumdar-Shaw remains the company's Chair and Managing Director", "4455": "Falcon", "4456": "weight", "4457": "Austrian", "4458": "183", "4459": "three", "4460": "Utah", "4461": "New York City", "4462": "14,000", "4463": "Laura Zuniga", "4464": "a form of torture", "4465": "50th", "4466": "Fox has ordered a new Ramsay series where the reality kingpin will partner with a team of hospitality experts", "4467": "two days", "4468": "save energy", "4469": "North Korea", "4470": "Baton Rouge native", "4471": "Liberty", "4472": "House of Commons Speaker", "4473": "south Jakarta", "4474": "global slump", "4475": "early 1980s", "4476": "dark-frame glasses and a white jogging suit with double black stripes on the sleeves", "4477": "helping New York City", "4478": "heavy accents or poor English can be difficult and frustrating.

I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.\r\n\r\nBy mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way.\r\n\r\nFinally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel. It was time to regroup and figure this out.\r\n\r\nThis was not the worse thing that has ever happened to me. I have survived worse situations.  Watch Gilbert Tuhabonye talk about his experiences \u00bb.\r\n\r\nI started to reflect upon the fact that every time I try and train hard for a marathon, something happens. Perhaps this is just not the right time for me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps God has something else in mind for me. I am being stubborn and pushing for something that is not supposed to be right now.\r\n\r\nNow, I am home in Austin, Texas some weeks later.  Watch Gilbert coaching his Gilbert's Gazelles \u00bb.\r\n\r\nThankfully, my hamstring was not torn. I have done physical therapy and massage therapy to repair the damage.\r\n\r\nI have been working hard at strengthening my core", "4545": "Seven", "4546": "Marek Edelman", "4547": "European Union foreign ministers said in a blistering statement Monday, adding the Syrian government's crackdown on anti-government protesters may amount to crimes against humanity.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe EU also expanded sanctions on Iran and Belarus to protest their crackdowns on their citizens, it announced.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut the 27 foreign ministers of the union reserved their sharpest criticism for Syria and its president.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The EU condemns in the strongest possible terms the ongoing brutal repression led by the Syrian regime,\" they said after a meeting in Luxembourg.\r\r\n\r\r\nSyria's leader must resign \"to allow a political transition to take place in Syria,\" they said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd they welcomed the creation of the umbrella opposition Syrian National Council, a day after Syria's foreign minister warned other nations against recognizing it.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe ministers said they were \"deeply disappointed\" that the United Nations Security Council failed to increase sanctions on Syria -- a milder statement than had been expected.\r\r\n\r\r\nEU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the union would continue to press for strong action on Syria.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe harsh words on Syria follow last week's failure by the U.N.

It calls for specific actions to counteract the inadequacies in this field.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report, women are nearly twice as likely as men to suffer from major depression. They are three times as likely to attempt suicide, and they experience anxiety disorders two to three times more often than men.  Chart: Gender and mental health \u00bb\r\n\r\nWhile these statistics are not new, their importance is generally underplayed, says Wanda Jones, Dr.P.H., health scientist and director of the OWH. She notes that whereas past reports have focused on bringing mental health to the forefront of concern -- such as the 1999 publication \"Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General\" -- few have focused primarily on the specific mental illness issues specific to women, hence the need for such a publication.\r\n\r\nAmong the actions recommended by the new report are the needs to underscore the essential importance of women's mental health to overall well-being, improve how primary care doctors and mental health professionals interface with each other, develop a greater understanding in the role of gender in mental illness,  recognize the role of trauma and violence against women and its subsequent impact on mental illness and address cultural biases that serve as barriers to treatment for many women.\r\n\r\nReasons for the gender disparities in mental health are still unclear, according to Jones. Part of the difference is based on biology. Female hormones, thyroid disease and brain biochemistry have all been cited as possible reasons. Genetics also play a part, as family history has proven that mental illness repeats itself across multiple generations. Socio-cultural reasons also contribute to the difference.\r\n\r\nJones stresses that the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to diagnosing and treating mental illness is not an effective approach and that acknowledging the gender differential is key to adequately and appropriately treating women.\r\n\r\nThe new report also underscores the relative young age", "4634": "Antarctica", "4635": "Miami", "4636": "two", "4637": "Saturday", "4638": "Iraqi", "4639": "a Visible Man", "4640": "Some Subways will still make you the popular pizza sub", "4641": "the depleted state of its armed forces", "4642": "Auschwitz Concentration Camp memorial in Poland", "4643": "Shanksville", "4644": "passing comprehensive reform", "4645": "$200 million", "4646": "The Army Criminal Investigation Division investigated alleged incidents", "4647": "Andre Aboolian", "4648": "dozens", "4649": "Wednesday", "4650": "Charlie Gibson", "4651": "Osama bin Laden", "4652": "McLaren", "4653": "30 percent", "4654": "Soviet-era satellite spinning around Earth", "4655": "Iraqi prosecution.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"If they want the benefits of what we can provide, if they want the assistance, if they want the training, if they want the operational skills that we can provide, then I think they have to understand that they've got to give us some protections in that process,\" Leon Panetta told sailors Friday during a visit to Naples, Italy, home of the U.S. 6th Fleet.\r\r\n\r\r\nPanetta's statement follows news this week that Iraq's top political leadership agreed that a number of American troops should remain in the country to aid in training and security, though said it was \"unnecessary\" to grant U.S. forces legal immunity.\r\r\n\r\r\nPanetta made the comments while answering a question from a sailor, who inquired about Iraq refusing to grant legal immunity to American forces and what it might mean for the future role of the U.S. military in Iraq.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is obviously a very pertinent question right now as we try to deal with the issue of whether or not we'll have a future presence in Iraq,\" Panetta said, according to a transcript released by the Department of Defense.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe defense secretary said negotiations were ongoing between Iraq's political leadership, U.S. Ambassador James F.

The prosecution has also alleged the Ellis went \"ballistic in a profane tirade\" that continued when police officers arrived.\r\n\r\nEllis, now a schoolteacher, denied all accusations against her, although she acknowledged in her Friday testimony that she touched another shopper's items on the conveyor belt.\r\n\r\nShe was initially charged with assaulting police officers, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace. Had she been convicted of those charges, she could have been sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.\r\n\r\nEllis, then a college student with no criminal history, has said that some white patrons shoved and hurled racial slurs at her when she switched checkout lines. Store employees refused to give her her change and called police, she said.\r\n\r\nShe said Friday that the incident began when she joined her cousin in the checkout line and was ignored by the clerk. She did not not cut in line and did not yell or use profanity, said Ellis, who has not spoken about the case outside of court.\r\n\r\nAs she left the store, Ellis told the Dunklin County Circuit Court, a police officer told her, \"Look at this stupid bitch. Take your ass back to the ghetto.\"\r\n\r\nShe alleged that an officer behind her forcefully grabbed her shoulder without telling her she was being arrested.\r\n\r\nShe did not resist, but said her body was \"flung around\" by officers. She screamed loudly for help as officers \"choked\" her and pulled her hair, but she did not hit or kick them, she testified.\r\n\r\nTestimony from Ellis' cousin, who was with her at the Wal-Mart, and from her aunt, whom the cousin called as Ellis was arrested, backed up the young woman's account.\r\n\r\nEllis said she saw a doctor after the incident because tight handcuffs had cut her and made her bleed. She said she also had a headache and neck pain from the incident.\r\n\r\nAn emergency room doctor testified that he had seen bruises on one of Ellis' wrists, but did not see cuts or bleeding. He also said he did not see any neck or head injuries.\r\n\r\nSurveillance tapes from the store were shown in court Thursday and released publicly, but the tapes don't show much of the alleged confrontation.\r\n\r\nA camera from above the cash register appeared to show Ellis' arm shoving merchandise to the side on the register's conveyor belt. Another camera showed her being led out of the store by police, with her arm in the air. A third, from the parking lot, showed her being handcuffed and put into a police car. It appeared to show Ellis kicking backward at police, as authorities allege. Her defense maintains she did so after police had assaulted her.\r\n\r\nOfficials with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference have said the case is indicative of racial bias in the town, where 13 percent of the population is African-American.\r\n\r\nBlack and Hispanic residents have long complained of being unfairly profiled during traffic stops by the predominantly white police department.\r\n\r\nWhen Ellis' supporters held a peaceful rally in June, officers found business cards scattered along the route that read: \"You have been paid a social visit by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

In some respects, Chen said, she actually misses her dog more than she misses her parents.\r\n\r\n\"My dog never says 'Go to bed,' or 'You have to be in by two,' \" she said. \"My dog just says, 'I'm happy to see you, even if it's 2:30 in the morning.' \"\r\n\r\nGW's Facebook network has its own group for pet lovers: \"I Miss My Dog.\" Its 89 members frequently post pictures of their \"four- and sometimes three-legged friends at home,\" as the group's description states.\r\n\r\nThe group's active members use it as a way to further express themselves on Facebook and to cope with missing their animals back home.\r\n\r\nLike Chen, junior Jared Stone said he did not realize how much his dogs were a part of his life until he came to college.\r\n\r\n\"In the past, I had always been at home and always been around my dogs,\" Stone said. \"I was used to having them nearby and petting them while watching TV.

[D]ropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American.\"\r\n\r\nThe president's commitment to education is truly remarkable, considering the enormous array of policy challenges confronting the administration. From health care and the economic crisis, to global warming and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration is beset by controversies that will not be easily resolved.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the president and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, have not allowed education to be ignored or placed on the back burner says a great deal about their recognition of its central importance to our nation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the administration navigates its way into the policy debates that are swirling over the future of education, it would be wise for it to proceed with caution.\r\n\r\nThe administration has already staked out positions on a number of issues -- charter schools and merit pay for teachers being two of the big ones -- which run the risk of generating additional controversy in the polarized debates over how to reform education.\r\n\r\nIf these issues and the stimulus money being made available under the Race to the Top (RTT) program are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue. The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers.\r\n\r\nThe current policy debates over the direction of education are typically presented as battles between the reformers, led by school superintendents like Joel Klein of New York and Michelle Rhee of Washington, D.C., and the defenders of the status quo, most often presented as the powerful teacher unions and other elements of the education establishment.\r\n\r\nWhile anyone familiar with the current debates knows that the differences between the two sides are real and profound, a protracted battle over the direction of education reform is not a good thing either for the administration or for those who genuinely want to see improvement in public education.\r\n\r\nInstead of choosing sides, it would be wise for the administration to do all it can to find common ground between the opposing camps as it formulates new policy initiatives.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of requiring states to adopt some form of merit pay for teachers -- a measure to which both the teachers' unions, the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have already declared their opposition -- the administration could encourage states to adopt school-based formulas that reward increases in student achievement.\r\n\r\nThis is similar, though not identical, to the approach taken in New York City, one that encourages collaboration among teachers and recognizes the importance of evidence that children are learning.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, rather than touting charter schools as the solution to public education, the administration should treat the best charters as models of innovation that provide educators with the flexibility to implement new strategies. This is a subtle but important distinction that has been lacking in many of the administration's pronouncements about charter schools.\r\n\r\nUnlike the public schools, many charter schools find ways to avoid serving the most disadvantaged students, and their teachers often work a longer day and longer school year without a contract.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of the best charters are subsidized by private philanthropists and are able to spend considerably more per pupil than traditional public schools. These facts should not be used to negate the accomplishments of the excellent charter schools that have emerged in many large cities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is far more likely that struggling public schools in these same cities would be more open to learning from the charters' accomplishments if they were not cast as competitors.\r\n\r\nFinally, the president has championed the idea of \"promise neighborhoods\" as a way to increase the availability of social services to children in high poverty communities, using as a model the Harlem Childrens Zone.\r\n\r\nIf this initiative is to result in lasting benefits to children, it will need to be combined with creative approaches to reforming urban public schools that re-formulate how we think about standards and focus attention more intently on how to deliver quality instruction to children.\r\n\r\nWith dropout rates at over 50 percent in several of our nation's cities, the administration must realize that tinkering at the margins with No Child Left Behind will not deliver the change we need.\r\n\r\nThe president entered office promising to bring a new kind of politics", "4720": "Jose Theodore", "4721": "more than $1 trillion", "4722": "the woman at the center of the John Edwards sex scandal", "4723": "north east of England", "4724": "three-year-old girl, and her wild encounter is thrilling online viewers around the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe video shows young New Zealander Sofia Walker facing off with a large lion on a viewing platform while visiting the Wellington Zoo with her family last week.\r\r\n\r\r\nMalik the lion had just been given his breakfast when he noticed Sofia pressing up against the viewing glass.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe big cat then twitches, glares and growls at the young girl just inches", "4725": "Nine", "4726": "'victory", "4727": "police cruisers", "4728": "United Nations", "4729": "Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, helped dash the youngest Kennedy brother's chances at the Oval Office in 1972 and 1980.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was more forgiving than the rest of the nation, however, backing Kennedy by a 3-to-2 margin in his 1970 bid to keep his Senate seat.

F--- them,\" she allegedly said as her husband, Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, bandied about a scheme to withhold state funds from the Cubs' parent Tribune Company unless the owner agreed to fire certain Chicago Tribune employees.\n\nSeven days later, according to the affidavit, she took part in a meeting about whether President-elect Barack Obama would secure a lucrative job for her if her husband appointed Obama's preferred candidate to his vacant Senate seat.\n\nU.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has said Patricia Blagojevich is not the target of the investigation of the governor's alleged attempts to sell Obama's Senate seat, pressure the Chicago Tribune and threaten to withdraw funding from a children's hospital.  Watch what prosecutors say was the first lady's role in alleged scandal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nA glance at her profile on the governor's Web site details a list of philanthropic endeavors, including awareness campaigns for breast cancer, heart disease and food allergies. She also has championed children's health care and literacy, and has parlayed her love for gardening into the State Beautification Initiative.\n\n\"As first lady, she works hard to promote initiatives that will help the families of Illinois bring up happy, healthy and successful children,\" her biography says.\n\nBlagojevich and her family have been part of the Chicago machine for decades. The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko", "4808": "Shiite areas", "4809": "yourself, your services, your family", "4810": "his ankle is still a little swollen", "4811": "14", "4812": "an emotional Kiley Barnes", "4813": "100 yards", "4814": "Walter Kerr Theater", "4815": "physical world", "4816": "Nebraska", "4817": "500-year-old", "4818": "sick with worry", "4819": "Eight", "4820": "Jackson 5", "4821": "felony conspiracy counts", "4822": "a hail of bullets", "4823": "FMLN party", "4824": "February 13, 2009", "4825": "Republican", "4826": "Britain's Got Talent.\"\r\n\r\nSusan Boyle fans watch her perform for the final time on \"Britain's Got Talent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boyle Backlash\" said the headline in the tabloid News of the World, suggesting that the Scottish 48-year-old's alleged \"four-letter tantrum\" earlier this week had influenced millions of viewers to switch their votes to dance act Diversity.\r\n\r\nThe buildup to Saturday night's live final had been dominated by reports that Boyle", "4827": "abuse", "4828": "the officer", "4829": "Thirty-three percent", "4830": "Manchester United and England", "4831": "silver", "4832": "a wealthy Turkish Arab family", "4833": "Michael Jackson", "4834": "water waste", "4835": "northern Baghdad", "4836": "Conway", "4837": "the big cinema thrills and chills, should add up to continued box office success", "4838": "NEW YORK", "4839": "basketball", "4840": "conservative and alert in the future.\n\nThe 21-year-old, who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation, said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender", "4841": "Bear Grylls", "4842": "World News", "4843": "breast cancer", "4844": "gold for Canada", "4845": "the menu", "4846": "U.S. first", "4847": "Disease Control and Prevention, autism and related disorders", "4848": "every house", "4849": "the \"Jena Six", "4850": "Friday", "4851": "June of 1993", "4852": "hotel peepholes", "4853": "flooding has left 50,000 people homeless in Nepal and killed", "4854": "Uncharted 3", "4855": "East Asian nation", "4856": "first lady with professional and personal interest", "4857": "10 mSv increases an individual's cancer risk by 0.02 percent", "4858": "the U.N.

In the heat of an attack, there can be only one final decision-maker.\"\r\n\r\nPhillips said that, in his opinion, arming a ship's crew \"cannot and should not be viewed as the best or ultimate solution to the problem. ... To the extent we go forward in this direction, it would be my personal preference that only a limited number of individuals aboard the vessel should have access to weapons, and they should be specially trained.\"\r\n\r\nHe warned that \"even this limited approach to arming the crews opens up a very thorny set of issues. ...

But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in \"Mad Men\"?\r\n\r\nBatt: The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience, but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever. What a great role to play. This season, I'm married. I get stopped all the time on the street, and I get asked, \"When is your character coming out?\" What is he coming out to in 1962?\r\n\r\nI asked to get married this season. I thanked [series creator] Matthew Weiner, and he said, \"You asked.\" It provides another wonderful level to the character. That is what happened then and unfortunately still happens today.\r\n\r\n[In a recent episode, the \"Gold Violin,\"] the scene with my wife, it was just so poignant and painful, someone said to me that what she loved about the episode was that we clearly did love each other. We were like the gold violin, we were beautiful but we just didn't make music\r\n\r\nCNN: What would you like to see Hollywood do?\r\n\r\nBatt: Continue to reward good work and put positive role models out there. The one thing about \"Brokeback Mountain\" -- it was a beautifully filmed and acted film depicting a tortured relationship.

According to Sharfstein, the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nBisphenol-A is found in many products, but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula, and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys. A handful of states and cities including Minnesota, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, have passed laws in some form banning BPA in products meant for children.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position is a partial reversal of the FDA's declaration in 2008 that BPA has no adverse effects. That announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry-funded research.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince then, the agency says on its Web site, \"recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals. While BPA is not proven to harm children or adults, these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of BPA.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program, which in its own 2008 report said there is \"some concern\" for BPA's effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. Other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the authors of those studies say it's not clear the problems were actually caused by BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt a news conference Friday, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said further research is needed \"to determine if and when further action is needed.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has been allotted $30 million to study the health effects of BPA. Hamburg said that research would likely be complete in 18 to 24 months.

India's richest woman is ready to answer your questions.\r\n\r\nKiran Mazumdar-Shaw, founder of biotech pharaceutical company Biotech answers your questions, below.\r\n\r\nYours is a very inspiring story. Could you tell us more about what challenges you had to overcome to bring Biocon to a global level? Vishala Vasandani\r\n\r\nMazumdar Shaw: My journey started 30 years ago at a time when I had to face credibility challenges that pertained to my gender, my inexperience as a business entrepreneur and my unfamiliar biotechnology-based business model. My business evolved in tandem with challenges.\r\n\r\nOnce I overcame these credibility challenges, I faced technological challenges of trying to build a Biotech business in a country that had infrastructure that was too primitive to support a high tech industry that demanded uninterrupted power supply, high quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, advanced scientific skills etc.\r\n\r\nOver the next 10 years, we systematically addressed these challenges and built a self contained enterprise that had captive power and water supply, state of the art labs and facilities and a team of highly experienced scientists and engineers capable of delivering world class research and technologies.\r\n\r\nToday, our challenges address those posed by new medical wisdom: addressing unmet medical needs, researching new drugs, new drug delivery systems and new therapies. Overcoming each of these phases has been a rich learning experience that has helped us to develop world class expertise in biotechnology. Innovation and quality have been integral to our business ethos.\r\n\r\nCan Biocon's oral insulin IN-105 replace traditional and painful needle based insulin delivery system for type1 diabetics? Can a diabetic who is taking insulin by needle based delivery system hope for change in near future?  Ajay Kumar Singh\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: Oral Insulin is not just about delivering Insulin in a tablet. It is about delivering Insulin very rapidly to the liver (hepato-delivery) which is the main organ responsible for glycemic control in our body. Injectable Insulin takes approximately 30 minutes to act. Oral Insulin takes approximately 5 minutes to act which mimics how non-diabetics respond to glucose uptake when food is consumed. This will help both Type I and Type II diabetics to manage their diabetes better.\r\n\r\nWe hope that early intervention with Oral Insulin will help to manage Diabetes especially in Type II diabetics much more effectively than is being done by oral diabetic agents like Metformin, Sulphonyl Ureas and Glitazones which stimulate the pancreas to produce Insulin.\r\n\r\nThis is unlike oral Insulin which will allow a poorly functioning pancreas to rest and hopefully help to revive Insulin secreting beta cells. Should our Oral Insulin program succeed, this will revolutionize Diabetes therapy in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you had to do the IPO again what would you do differently and when can we see Biocon listed in NASDAQ?  Harish Swaminathan\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I don't believe so. I think we got the valuation we were expecting through an Indian listing. A NASDAQ listing is only something we will address when one of our branded drugs are close to commercialization in either the U.S. or European markets. Today NASDAQ is risk averse and not valuing biotech companies any better than the BSE or NSE.\r\n\r\nI am so humbled by your story. What does it take as a woman to get to where you are today? What obstacles did you have to overcome, especially in an industry that is deemed to be a \"man's world\"? Would women setting up business in India today find it easier than you did? Irene Gonza, Uganda\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I believe that women need to believe in themselves. I set up Biocon with a spirit of challenge and a deep sense of purpose. The challenge was to break the gender bias in the business world.\r\n\r\nMy sense of purpose was to create a Biotech business in a country like India", "5064": "slaying by government forces and defended the craft of journalism", "5065": "Jacques Kallis", "5066": "serious brain infection and even death", "5067": "how they will get their next meals", "5068": "Harlem's Apollo Theater", "5069": "September 11, 2001", "5070": "displaying magazine pages", "5071": "Ed McMahon", "5072": "Kashmir", "5073": "first", "5074": "Patrick Dempsey", "5075": "more than $100,000 a year, compared to slightly more than 16 percent of MySpace users.

Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons.\r\n\r\nHis attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is \"not guilty of the charges.

And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them.\"\r\n\r\nA procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, Conley said.\r\n\r\nA Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman \"put up a fight,\" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service.\r\n\r\nShe sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified.\r\n\r\nAuthorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.  Watch police say assailant has perused Craigslist ads \u00bb\r\n\r\nSurveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man.\r\n\r\nPolice traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and \"the case just begins to build from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,\" Conley said.\r\n\r\nThere may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. \"If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is \"bearing up,\" according to attorney Salsberg.\r\n\r\n\"It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty,\" said Salsberg.\r\n\r\nMcAllister, in her e-mail to ABC, wrote, \"Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it.

Nujood Ali is not among them.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood Ali today is angry and skips school but is still relieved her defiance paid off.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe find her at the family's two-room house in an impoverished suburb of the Yemeni capital. Nujood is angry, combative and yelling. Tension surrounds the home like a noose.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter much arguing with family members, Nujood  finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with CNN. Her presence is grudging, although CNN got advance permission to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was faring.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago. Then, there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child, a portrait of innocence. She had a shy smile, playful nature and a whimsical giggle.\r\r\n\r\r\nHer retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting.  Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World's Untold Stories \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nThe story was supposed to end with the divorce. There was, though, a stunning transformation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph. Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the fall of 2008, Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year, alongside some of the world's most impressive women. She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere is a tell-all book, which is to be published in more than 20 languages, and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's strength was celebrated by complete strangers. But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform?\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There is no change at all since going on television,\" Nujood says bitterly. \"I hoped there was someone to help us, but we didn't find anyone. It hasn't changed a thing. They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me. I wish I had never spoken to the media.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere was never going to be a fortune. Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school, but she refuses to attend, according to Shada Nasser, the human rights lawyer who took on the child's divorce case.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I know Nujood was absent from the school. I spoke with her father and her family. And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school. But they said, 'You know we don't have the money for the transportation. Don't have the money for the food,' \" says Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents say they've received nothing, and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I was happy I got divorced but I'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television,\" she said, adding that she feels like an outcast even among  family and friends.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly. And yet, as a wife, she was spared nothing.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I didn't want to sleep with him but he forced me to, he hit me, insulted me,\" she said. She described being married and living as a wife at such a young age as sheer torture.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood described how she was beaten and raped and how, after just a few weeks of marriage, she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement. But her parents told her they could not protect her, that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate.\r\r\n\r\r\nCNN tried to get comment from the girl's ex-husband and family, but they declined.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents, like many others in Yemen, struck a social bargain. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18, many times to older men, some with more than one wife.\r\r\n\r\r\nMarriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. But Nujood's parents say they did not expect the girl's new husband to demand sex from his child bride.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter several hours, a judge finally went to see her. \"And he asked me, 'what do you want' and I said 'I want a divorce' and he said 'you're married?' And I said 'yes.'\" says Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing, and the girl was put in the care of Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with her that she should get her divorce.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut based on the principles of Shariah law, her husband was compensated, not prosecuted. Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day.\r\r\n\r\r\nKhadije Al Salame is working to help the girl get her life back. Now a Yemeni diplomat, she too was a child bride 30 years ago. But when she left her husband, she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe said: \"It's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out, but the problem is it's too much pressure on her.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"She doesn't understand what's going on. She's a little girl and we have to understand as media people that we should leave her alone now. If we really love Nujood then we should just let her go to school and continue with her life, because education is the most important thing for her.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nTo get her divorce, Nujood showed character and strength not easily expressed by women in Yemen", "5109": "his wife and two young sons", "5110": "three", "5111": "Wallen", "5112": "her nation's cuisine  to CNN anchor and correspondent Kristie Lu Stout", "5113": "first 100 days, but his approval rating had tanked by June of 1993.
