Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles \u00bb\r\n\r\nCNN: When did you come out?\r\n\r\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\r\n\r\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in \"Mad Men\"?\r\n\r\nBatt: The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience, but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever.

Anything short of that is too risky.\r\n\r\nKaren is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective, widely available interventions. She compares Alzheimer's disease prevention to the polio vaccine: \"Had a vaccine not been developed for polio, hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe. Similarly, not only is treatment of Alzheimer's likely to be less effective than prevention, it's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive,\" she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine.\r\n\r\nKaren and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility: a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\nSo what's the holdup?

Tobin responded with a statement Sunday followed by his television appearance Monday, in which he acknowledged holding Kennedy to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy.\r\n\r\nThe issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men. A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House.\r\n\r\nKennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language.\r\n\r\nRequests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion \"a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions. He acknowledged \"a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion.\"\r\n\r\nOther Catholics questioned Tobin's stance.\r\n\r\n\"The simple fact is that most bishops don't want to deny communion to politicians, and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II gave communion to pro-choice Italian politicians,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University. \"So the question is, is Bishop Tobin more Catholic than the pope on this?\"\r\n\r\nPoliticians have previously run afoul of Catholic bishops on the abortion issue.

In it, Joseph and Katherine Jackson stand at the foot of a set of stairs, their star children -- known as the Jackson 5 -- arrayed behind them.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson brothers, here in the 1970s, were driven to be great by their father, Joseph.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be the all-American clan, gold records arranged behind them, the boys loose and smiling, the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor.\r\n\r\nOver the years, that fa\u00e7ade crumbled. The brothers bickered; some made accusations of abuse. But the group remained tight-knit through crises, including Thursday's tragedy, when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center.\r\n\r\nThe journey began with music in Gary, Indiana. Joseph Jackson, the patriarch, played in a short-lived band called the Falcons (no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett) in the 1950s. His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel.\r\n\r\nKatherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966.\r\n\r\nBy that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: \"He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, \"Please don't be mad at me.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson disputed the word \"beat,\" but didn't question Michael's account.\r\n\r\n\"I whipped him with a switch and a belt,\" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, \"I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick.\"\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions.\r\n\r\n\"We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,\" he said. \"I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \"chitlin circuit\" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \"the last big stars to come off my assembly line,\" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site.\r\n\r\nThe group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a collaboration,\" Gamble said. \"They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians.\"\r\n\r\nHuff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a \"fantastic meal\" cooked by Katherine Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing but respect for the father,\" added Gamble. \"He's a great man. He made something out of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nEven during that era, however, Michael was standing out. Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded. Going solo with Quincy Jones producing, as he did in 1979, was the right move, Gamble and Huff said.\r\n\r\nThe family dynamics kept changing as the siblings grew older. After Michael's \"Thriller\" became the biggest album of all time, the brothers -- including Jermaine -- regrouped for a new album, \"Victory,\" and accompanying tour. But Michael, now the undisputed draw, disagreed with some of the tour plans and ended up donating his earnings to charity.\r\n\r\nMichael's brightened spotlight boosted the careers of his siblings; even Rebbie had a hit. But it was Janet who broke out with the most success, including the No. 1 singles \"Miss You Much,\" \"Black Cat\" and \"Again\" in the 1980s and '90s.\r\n\r\nWith the increased interest in the Jacksons came tabloid scrutiny of the family's every move. When La Toya appeared nude in Playboy magazine, the story made headlines. She later criticized Michael and was on the outs for several years.\r\n\r\nJermaine put out a song called \"Word to the Badd,\" an attack on Michael, in 1991; he later changed the lyrics. Janet's relationships were probed in detail, as were the brothers' marriages.\r\n\r\nAnd Michael, of course, was seen as increasingly eccentric, his personality overwhelming his music.\r\n\r\nBut for all their own bickering, the family closed ranks when a member was attacked. In 1992, Jermaine co-produced \"The Jacksons: An American Dream,\" a TV miniseries based on Katherine Jackson's memoir, which chronicled their rise to stardom. When Michael faced molestation allegations in the early '90s and was tried in 2005, the family rallied around.\r\n\r\n\"The Jackson family was groomed to be a team,\" said Linda Johnson Rice, president and CEO of Ebony and Jet magazines' Johnson Publishing and a longtime family friend. \"As you can see through their performances, they were always there for each other.\"\r\n\r\nIn recent years, La Toya has appeared on the reality shows \"Armed and Famous\" and the UK \"Celebrity Big Brother.\" She originally had a scene in the forthcoming Sacha Baron Cohen movie, \"Bruno,\" but CNN", "114": "the Sunday vote", "115": "George Zinkhan", "116": "$163 million", "117": "many irregularities for their allegations", "118": "Philip Shapiro", "119": "Atlanta woman", "120": "MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- India's Home Minister Shivraj Patil", "121": "basic philosophy", "122": "the United Nations Security Council.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe said they forged \"a strong draft with the cooperation of Russia and China,\" the two countries that have been reluctant to impose strong sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We plan to circulate the draft resolution to the entire Security Council today,\" said Clinton, who made the remarks before she began testifying about START, the U.S.-Russian treaty on nuclear arms.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe P5 plus 1 comprises the five permanent member of the Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, France, and Britain -- as well as Germany.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe group has been concerned that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons.

The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend.\r\n\r\n\"We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,\" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. \"It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paranormal Activity\" bills itself as \"the first-ever major film release demanded by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors. But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \"With its this-is-really-happening vibe, 'Paranormal Activity' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich\u00e9s. The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the film has earned a strong 85 percent approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\r\n\r\nMoviegoers agree. Rajiim Gross, an iReporter who posted a review of the film, said he found \"Paranormal Activity\" to be much better than \"Blair Witch Project,\" another indie-horror film to which it is being compared. Check out Rajiim Gross' iReport\r\n\r\n\"It actually scared the hell out of me,\" Gross said. \"I saw it during the day and I would hate to be someone who went home after seeing it late at night.\"\r\n\r\nGross said he believed the studio was smart to leverage the Internet to spread the word.

Her brother is an adviser to Obama's transition team.\r\n\r\nAlexander's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from \"American Sublime\" (Graywolf Press):\r\n\r\nPoetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner,\r\n\r\noverhear on the bus, God / in the details, the only way\r\n\r\nto get from here to there. / Poetry (and now my voice is rising)\r\n\r\nis not all love, love, love, / and I'm sorry the dog died.\r\n\r\nPoetry (here I hear myself loudest) / is the human voice,\r\n\r\nand are we not of interest to each other?\r\n\r\nAlexander spoke Friday to CNN.com.\r\n\r\nCNN: What do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this?\r\n\r\nAlexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle.\r\n\r\nCNN: You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago?\r\n\r\nAlexander: In the community in Hyde Park, he and Mrs. Obama were just people I'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about, and we were of a generation. ...\r\n\r\nHe was in the law school, and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work didn't really cross so much. ... [We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community.\r\n\r\nCNN: And you did it by writing?\r\n\r\nAlexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years.\r\n\r\nCNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you?\r\n\r\nAlexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, \"Isn't that something?\" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's ahead of us?\r\n\r\nAlexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ...\r\n\r\nThe larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better.\r\n\r\nCNN: Can poetry help in that regard?\r\n\r\nAlexander: I do believe that it can.

Once fully trained, he will assist federal and local police officers as well as private corporations in nosing out deadly explosives at schools, airports and public events.\r\n\r\nHis detective skills can potentially save thousands of lives in an era where law enforcement agencies are aggressively fighting against drugs and terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\n\"Think about a scenario like the 1996 Olympic bombings,\" says Kaden's trainer Jeff Schettler, a cheery man who has coached hundreds of dogs to sniff out bombs, drugs, missing people and corpses since the mid-1990s.\r\n\r\nDemand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement. The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S. The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Watch three detection puppies in action \u00bb\r\n\r\nOfficial records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S. In more recent years, police departments realized a dog's nose was a valuable asset.\r\n\r\nDogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others. For each drop of odor detected by a dog, the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000 drops of odor, veterinarians say.  Can your pooch be a detection dog? \u00bb\r\n\r\nOther animals may have smelling skills that rival a dog's, such as pigs nosing for truffles in France or honey bees that can sniff out TNT particles, but veterinarians say dogs are the most controllable and sociable for their human handlers.\r\n\r\nPolice dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection, police officers say. Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats. They can find children who have mysteriously vanished overnight. Detection dogs can even weed out pest-infested apples and oranges accidentally left in suitcases at airports.\r\n\r\n\"They are a growing aspect of law enforcement,\" says Jim Watson, secretary at the North American Police Work Dog Association and a handler for decades.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, investigators were baffled during the international manhunt for George Zinkhan, a former University of Georgia professor accused of fatally shooting his wife and two other people.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks into the search, two cadaver dogs, a German shepherd named Circe and an Australian shepherd named Madison, arrived. Within 10 hours, the dogs picked up the scent of Zinkhan's remains in a shallow pit hidden in a thick forest. Once the dogs neared the suspect's body, they gave their handlers personalized signals. Circe barked excitedly. Madison lay down.\r\n\r\nTrainer Jeff Schettler explains Kaden is an unlikely candidate for police work. Basenjis, a breed that originated in central Africa, are usually used as hunting or show dogs. There are only two other trained police dog basenjis recorded by the North American Police Work Dog Association.\r\n\r\nMost trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs, preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record. Most law enforcement agencies rely on Belgian Malinoises and German shepherds for detection work because of their protective yet friendly personalities, but labs, bloodhounds and beagles also can be used.\r\n\r\n\"We're not trying to fix anything,\" Schettler says. \"We're trying to enhance it.\"\r\n\r\nSchettler points out some of Kaden's advantages: The dog's weight will peak at about 25 pounds, enabling him seamlessly to sift between cramped luggage and lockers. Kaden is barkless because basenjis have an oddly shaped larynx, ideal for quiet searches.\r\n\r\nOn a recent rainy Saturday morning at the Georgia K9 National Training Center, little Kaden undergoes testing. Passing the exam depends on his whiffing talents.\r\n\r\nUpon the instructor's command, Kaden's pencil-thin legs playfully trot along the damp grass to an oversize wall scattered with dozens of holes. His instructor has hidden black gunpowder wrapped in pantyhose in one of the holes.\r\n\r\nIf Kaden's nose sniffs out the gunpowder, he will immediately sit.\r\n\r\nKaden begins on the left side, quickly taking a zigzag pattern from one hole to another. His pace is methodical, a sniff for each hole. Soon he slows, pauses, inhales again and then sinks his tiny hindquarters to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"What a good boy,\" coo several of Kaden's trainers, stroking his sleek fur and rewarding him with one of his favorite treats, torn bits of venison jerky.\r\n\r\nAs Kaden nibbles on his treat, Schettler admits there are drawbacks to training basenjis. Basenjis don't have a furry coat to endure cold weather like a German shepherd.\r\n\r\nBasenjis are also a highly independent, stubborn breed with personalities similar to cats, making them difficult to train. Kaden's personality, however, is contrary to most basenjis. He was culled from a litter in Atlanta at 7 days old because of his unusual sociability with humans.\r\n\r\n\"At eight weeks, he was in the airport going up to people and running around like he owned the place,\" Schettler says.\r\n\r\nTraining detection dogs such as Kaden often begins during puppyhood so imprinting scent differentiation becomes innate, handlers say.

First, tablet users tend to be more highly educated: Fifty-one percent have a college degree, compared with 28% of all Americans.\r\r\n\r\r\nTablet users also tend to be richer: Fifth-three percent have an annual household income greater than $75,000, compared with 28% of the total U.S. population. (Conversely, 15% of tablet users have an annual household income of less than $30,000, while over a third of American households earn that much or less each year.)\r\r\n\r\r\nMost tablet users have jobs: Sixty-two percent are employed full time, compared with 41% of the total population.\r\r\n\r\r\nAlong other demographic lines, tablets mostly mirror the general population in terms of gender, race and political ideology. But age indicates some differences: Nearly half (46%) of tablet users are age 30-49, while just 35% of Americans are in that age bracket. Also, only 7% of tablet owners are age 65 or older, while 17% of Americans are seniors. This part of the population is growing fast as baby boomers age.\r\r\n\r\r\nTablet users do seem to be hungry for news. The project notes: \"About half (53%) get news on their tablet every day, and they read long articles as well as get headlines.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMany news organizations are building and promoting their own apps specifically designed for tablets. The project found that about two-thirds of tablet users have a news app installed on their tablets, but that's not where they get most of their news, even on the tablet.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The browser, carried over from the desktop experience, is still the more popular means of consuming news,\" said the report. \"A plurality of tablet news users (40%) say they get their news mainly through a Web browser. Another 31% use news apps and the browser equally, while fewer, 21%, get their news primarily through apps.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nOf course, the tablet market is shifting fast.

And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as \"hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, \"and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption.\" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported.

The death penalty has now been abolished in 16 states.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn November, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber halted a pending execution and declared that no other executions would occur while he was in office.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I am convinced we can find a better solution that keeps society safe, supports the victims of crime and their families and reflects Oregon values,\" he said. \"I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut perhaps the loudest outcry was in Georgia, which executed Troy Davis despite serious doubts about his guilt and an international campaign to save his life. Thursday's report said the Davis case exposed the deep concerns over the death penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972, when the (Supreme) Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases,\" the report said.\r\r\n\r\r\nA CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in October found that for the first time in recent memory, more Americans favor a sentence of life in prison over the death penalty for murderers -- 50% to 48%.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat's not to say that Americans want to abolish the death penalty entirely.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther polls have shown majorities generally favor it, but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said his analysis shows there is a difference between thinking the government should have the death penalty as an option and actually wanting to see it applied.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe decline in the number who prefer the death penalty as the punishment for murder may be related to the growing number who believe that at least one person in the past five years has been executed for a crime that he or she did not commit.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 2005, when a solid majority preferred the death penalty, 59% believed that an innocent person had been executed within the previous five years. Now that figure has risen dramatically, to 72%.\r\r\n\r\r\nDavis drew widespread support for his claims that an innocent man was being put to death, after federal and state courts had rejected his calls for a new trial.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince Davis' conviction in 1991, seven of the nine witnesses against him recanted their testimony, and no physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of a Savannah police officer. However, a federal judge concluded the death row inmate \"vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nA Texas execution in July also attracted international attention. Mexican national Humberto Leal Garcia was convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl. A world court found the state violated his rights by not giving Leal access to his home country's consulate upon his arrest in 1994, as required by an international treaty. U.S. and Mexican officials, along with a variety of human rights groups, urged Texas to delay the execution, but to no avail.\r\r\n\r\r\nTexas continues to lead the nation as the busiest death penalty state, with 13 executions this year. Alabama was next with six, and Ohio with five. No more are scheduled until next month.\r\r\n\r\r\nThirty-four states have capital laws, but only 13 states carried out that ultimate punishment in 2011. In addition, several states with capital punishment laws did not sentence anyone to death in 2011, including Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and South Carolina.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnother high-profile murder convict in Pennsylvania saw his death sentence commuted. Prosecutors decided this month not to give Mumia Abu-Jamal a new capital sentencing hearing. He was convicted of murdering Philadelphia police office Daniel Faulkner, but has long claimed his innocence as a victim of what he called a racist criminal justice system. He will spend the rest of his life in prison.\r\r\n\r\r\nCalifornia voters could decide next year whether to abandon the death penalty. That state has the highest death row population -- 721 people -- but no one has been executed there since 2006, when a court-ordered moratorium was declared.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut one state that rarely has applied the death penalty could see two notorious killers receive that punishment. Steven Hayes was sentenced to death in Connecticut in December 2010, and a jury this month recommended the same punishment for Joshua Komisarjevsky. They were found guilty of home-invasion killings that left a mother and her two daughters dead. State legislators had contemplated abolishing capital punishment, but these defendants may have caused some rethinking, to allow the practice for only the worst of crimes.\r\r\n\r\r\nConnecticut and New Hampshire", "877": "a killer schedule-- intervened", "878": "doctors Sandeep Kapoor", "879": "Lech Kaczynski", "880": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- A fire charred the top of two of three wings of the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino on Friday, causing no major injuries but forcing visitors and employees to evacuate, authorities said.\r\n\r\nThe recently remodeled Monte Carlo Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, is shown after and before the fire.\r\n\r\nA bit over an hour after it began, the fire was fully contained, according to the fire departments in Las Vegas and Clark County.\r\n\r\nFirefighters would remain at the hotel until \"the fire is completely knocked out,\" said Clark County Fire Chief Steven M.

See where the hotel is located \u00bb\r\n\r\nNo one was trapped, and there were no reports of major injuries, said Ed Cagalo of the Clark County Fire Department. The 32-floor building was completely evacuated.\r\n\r\nThe blaze was reported about 11 a.m.\r\n\r\nBlack smoke and flames poured from the fire, which roared through the building's exterior stucco and foam until firefighters were able to get on the roof and knock down the flames.

It now resides at University College London and is occasionally moved so Bentham can \"attend\" meetings.\r\n\r\nBentham didn't want for the Auto-Icon to feature a wax head; he actually carried around the glass eyes he wanted used in his preserved face for years before his death. However, the preservation process distorted his face, so the wax replica had to stand in.\r\n\r\nFor many years Bentham's real head sat between his feet in the Auto-Icon, but it was such a target for pranksters that it eventually had to be locked away.

It's also about the same amount of radiation as other standard cardiac screenings, such as the nuclear stress test.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide range of exposures in the study depending on the medical center and the way the tests were performed. The median radiation dose ranged from 4.6 to 30 mSv. About 80 percent of the centers studied used techniques to reduce radiation, such as adjusting the CT scan to the patient's size (meaning smaller patients get less radiation) or precisely timing the radiation dose to a particular point in the heart rhythm (which shortens the duration of exposure). Health.com: How to help your heart for better health\r\n\r\nOverall, the danger posed by radiation is very small, according to Hausleiter.

Multiply that feeling by a million -- make that more than 2.4 million for every O reader -- and you'll know how I've felt over the past year every time I had to shoot a cover for O. If you're a regular subscriber, you'll notice you've not seen a head-to-toe shot all year. Why? Because I didn't want to be seen. \"\r\n\r\nIn 1992 I reached my heaviest, 237 pounds. I was 38. Then, four years ago, I made it a goal to lose weight, and I appeared on the January 2005 cover at a toned 160 pounds. I thought I was finished with the weight battle. I was done. I'd conquered it. I was so sure, I was even cocky. I had the nerve to say to friends who were struggling, \"All you have to do is work out harder and eat less! Get your 10,000 steps in! None of that starchy stuff!\"\r\n\r\nBam! Karma is a bear of a thing.\r\n\r\nSo here I stand, 40 pounds heavier than I was in 2006. (Yes, you're adding correctly; that means the dreaded 2-0-0.) I'm mad at myself. I'm embarrassed. I can't believe that after all these years, all the things I know how to do, I'm still talking about my weight. I look at my thinner self and think, \"How did I let this happen again?\" Oprah.com: How to prevent weight gain relapse\r\n\r\nIt happened slowly. In February 2007, at 53, I started to have some health issues. At first I was unable to sleep for days. My legs started swelling. My weight started creeping up, first 5 pounds, then 10 pounds. I was lethargic and irritable. My internal clock seemed totally out of whack. I began having rushing heart palpitations every time I worked out. Okay, I've never loved daily exercise, but this was different. I actually developed a fear of working out. I was scared that I would pass out. Or worse. I felt as if I didn't know my own body anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter many trips to various doctors, I received a diagnosis. I had hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course didn't make me lose a single pound) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism (a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain). My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must \"learn to embrace hunger\" or I would immediately gain weight. Believe me, no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the struggle I'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over. I felt completely defeated. I thought, \"I give up. I give up. Fat wins.\" All these years I'd had only myself to blame for lack of willpower. Now I had an official, documented excuse.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid diagnosis felt like some kind of prison sentence. I was so frustrated that I started eating whatever I wanted -- and that's never good. My drug of choice is food. I use food for the same reasons an addict uses drugs: to comfort, to soothe, to ease stress.\r\n\r\nI switched doctors and still gained weight. At one point I was on three medications: one for heart palpitations, another for high blood pressure, another to moderate my thyroid. Who knew this tiny butterfly gland at the base of the throat had so much power? When it's off, your whole body feels the effects. I followed my doctor's orders to the letter (except for the part about working out). I took the prescribed medication religiously at the same time each day. Oprah.com: The truth about your thyroid\r\n\r\nBeing medicated, though necessary, made me feel as if I were viewing life through a veil. I felt like an invalid. Everything was duller. I felt like the volume on life got turned down.\r\n\r\nI realized this to some extent, but I wasn't fully aware of the effect of the medication until I had a conversation with my friend Bob Greene. He'd given up lecturing me about working out and eating well, but we were walking together one day and he said, \"I think something's wrong. You're listless. Your movements are slower, even when you're just doing normal stuff. Twice I've told you something and you don't remember it. There's no sparkle in your eyes. I think you're in some sort of depression.\"  Greene talks about Oprah's struggle \u00bb\r\n\r\nMe -- depressed? I hadn't thought I was, but definitely something was off. I felt like the life force was being sucked out of me. I always had an excuse for being tired. It took extra effort to do everything. I didn't want to go anywhere, and I didn't want to be seen any more than I had to. I could oversee a show and a magazine that tell people how to live their best lives, but I definitely wasn't setting an example. I was talking the talk, but I wasn't walking the walk. And that was very disappointing to me.\r\n\r\nImmediately after that conversation with Bob, I called my doctor. \"All this medicine is making my life feel like a flat line,\" I said. So my doctor slowly weaned me off it, except for one aspirin a day. (By the way, never suddenly stop taking prescribed medication, especially heart and blood pressure medication, without checking with your physician.) That choice was the beginning of my road back to health -- and back to myself.

If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which handles unruly incidents deemed to be civil violations, has reported more than 900 cases over the past five years. In 2000, a series of incidents in which passengers verbally harassed and hit crew members prompted the FAA to boost the civil penalty fine for interfering with a crew member from a maximum of $1,100 to $25,000. The FBI usually handles more serious cases of abuse or dangerous behavior.\r\n\r\nThe FAA numbers don't reflect all the cases of inappropriate behavior, said Les Dorr, a spokesman for the agency. Crew members are used to experiencing the wrath of passengers who are frustrated by delays and missing baggage. Sometimes, these incidents aren't severe enough to be reported to government officials.\r\n\r\nMany confrontations occur when a flight attendant refuses to serve an intoxicated passenger another alcoholic beverage, according to flight attendants. When the temper tantrums get physical, airline officials may resort to plastic handcuffs and restraining tape.\r\n\r\nOn a Frontier Airlines flight in July 2007, passenger Tamera Freeman was seen physically abusing her children, who were crying, according to court documents. The court records show that when the flight attendant refused to serve her alcohol, Freeman threw her drink at the attendant.\r\n\r\nCrew members subsequently taped Freeman into her seat, and she spent three months in jail for the incident.\r\n\r\nPassengers who fail to comply with standard airline policies -- such as staying seated when the seat-belt sign is on or turning off electronics when the plane is landing  -- also spark confrontation, airline attendants said.\r\n\r\nChristina Szele, a New York passenger onboard JetBlue Airways in 2008, decided to smoke in her seat last summer despite the no-smoking law implemented on U.S. flights in 1990. Court documents revealed that when flight attendants asked Szele to stop, she began to yell obscenities and racial slurs. The flight was diverted to Denver, Colorado.\r\n\r\nSzele later was sentenced in U.S. District Court in Denver to serve five years' probation for interference with a JetBlue flight crew member. Szele was ordered to participate in anger management and drug and alcohol abuse treatment as well as fined nearly $8,000.\r\n\r\nTim Smith, an American Airlines spokesman, reported a slight decrease in the number of incidents of misconduct this year compared with last year. The number of unruly passenger incidents tracked by the FAA also has dipped since 2004.\r\n\r\nThe punishment for unruly", "1504": "women and children", "1505": "Srebrenica", "1506": "cholera, 25km from Harare, Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nMalnutrition has left this baby born in Zimbabwe fighting for her life.

It failed because Holder spoke more like a grade school principal than like the attorney general of the United States. He framed our nation's continuing racial work as a struggle to feel comfortable, be tolerant, and have \"frank conversations about racial matters.\"\r\n\r\nI appreciate the sentiment, but I would prefer Holder use the Department of Justice to sue those who illegally discriminate against racial minorities rather than holding encounter sessions in the lunchroom.\r\n\r\nFebruary's celebration of black history is important because it reminds us that America's bitter racial legacy is not about name calling and hurt feelings; it is about structures of inequality codified in law and supported by government action.\r\n\r\nBlack men and women risked their lives to gain the right to vote, to live where they chose, to educate their children in the best public schools, and to end segregation in transportation and public places.\r\n\r\nBlack political history is the story of a battle against structures. Unfortunately, too many of those structures still exist. As attorney general, Eric Holder is charged, in part, with eliminating those violations of law that still create systematic racial inequality.\r\n\r\nIn Holder's optimistic portrayal of modern America, we are a nation fundamentally altered by Brown v. Board of Education; a country that has \"done a pretty good job melding the races in the workplace;\" and a nation whose biggest racial obstacle is making our weekend socializing as congenial as our workweek happy hours.\r\n\r\nMaybe Holder doesn't realize that in many cities and towns the public schools are more segregated today than they were 40 years ago. A recent report from the Chicago Urban League found that African-American children in the city are almost exclusively educated in schools that are more than 85 percent black.\r\n\r\nThese vastly predominantly black schools have fewer resources, fewer extracurricular activities and fewer experienced teachers than their white counterparts.\r\n\r\nChildren from these schools are more likely to drop out or end up incarcerated than to enroll in college.\r\n\r\nSegregation is no longer the law of the land, but America's children continue to be educated in separate and unequal schools. We can't talk our way out of unequal schools.\r\n\r\nHolder's perspective that black and white workers get along easily in the workplace reflects a shocking disregard for contemporary employment realities. African-Americans continue to suffer from extraordinary employment discrimination at every stage of hiring and promotion and in every sector of the job market.\r\n\r\nFor example, my Princeton University colleague, sociologist Devah Pager, has demonstrated that white men with criminal records are more likely to be considered for a job than black men with no criminal past.\r\n\r\nI am deeply concerned that the leader of the Department of Justice seems to believe that our workplaces need dialogue, discourse, and understanding rather than fair hiring practices, equal pay, and transparent promotion procedures. We can't talk our way out of employers who refuse to interview a job candidate if the name on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \"sounds black.\"\r\n\r\nHolder discussed weekend segregation as if it is just a matter of personal recreational choice: White folks go off to NASCAR and black people prefer to watch basketball. But the reason Americans do not share racial vocabulary or opportunities for interracial dialogue is because of deeply entrenched racial residential segregation.\r\n\r\nWe don't spend our weekends together because we don't live in the same neighborhoods. Housing segregation is not just a matter of personal choice. Some real estate agents steer black families away from predominantly white neighborhoods. Some property owners refuse to rent to black families. Both of these acts are illegal.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the National Fair Housing Alliance documents hundred of thousands of acts of housing discrimination each year and has repeatedly criticized the Department of Justice for failing to adequately pursue and prosecute the vast majority of these cases. We can't talk our way out of residential segregation.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher, I am deeply committed to interracial dialogue. I try to use my classroom as a site of conversation, deliberation, and debate about race. I do this because, as a teacher, dialogue is the most powerful weapon I have in the fight to build a better America.\r\n\r\nEric Holder has something more. He has the law.

Ray Odierno, issued a joint statement expressing sadness over al-Hakim's death and describing him as \"a national leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,\" the statement said. \"We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.\"  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future \u00bb\r\n\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered his condolences, saying al-Hakim was \"like an old brother.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Maliki credited him for being a \"strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq.\"\r\n\r\n\"His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,\" al-Maliki said in the statement.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim ended his more than 20-year exile in Iran in 2003, when he returned to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his regime.\r\n\r\n\"It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,\" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. \"I was longing to see them. My goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them.\"\r\n\r\nIraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return.\r\n\r\nDuring his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHe took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south.\r\n\r\nSCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word \"revolution,\" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man.\r\n\r\nHis political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did.\r\n\r\nGovernment ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad.\r\n\r\nAnd when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence", "1871": "an associate professor at the Carey School of Business", "1872": "intercept the vessel in the Mediterranean Sea, witnesses and Israeli officials said.\r\n\r\nThe Dignity arrives in Tyre, Lebanon, after it was reportedly rammed by an Israeli military vessel Tuesday.\r\n\r\nCNN correspondent Karl Penhaul was aboard the 60-foot pleasure boat Dignity when the contact occurred. When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre, severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat, and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed.

Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities, the captain said.\r\n\r\nBut Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area.\r\n\r\nPalmor said there was no response to the radio message, and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat, leading to the collision.  Watch Penhaul describe the boat damage \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally, Penhaul said, but Palmor called those allegations \"absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody,\" Palmor said.\r\n\r\n\"I would call it ramming.

The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend.\r\n\r\n\"We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,\" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. \"It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paranormal Activity\" bills itself as \"the first-ever major film release demanded by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors. But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \"With its this-is-really-happening vibe, 'Paranormal Activity' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich\u00e9s. The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the film has earned a strong 85 percent approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\r\n\r\nMoviegoers agree.

I am proud to be there to represent them today.\n\nAfter almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.\n\nAfter 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.\n\nBlackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.\n\nAt the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.\n\nThe areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.\n\nAny incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.\n\nIn doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.\n\nBlackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.\n\nThe company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented.\n\nThe worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards.\n\nIn Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force. Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions.\n\nMy understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation, but those results are not yet available. We at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday, and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions.\n\nI just want to put some other things in perspective.\n\nA recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone, areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq, and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged, or less than 3 percent of all movements.\n\nIn 2006, Blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the Red Zone. Weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions.\n\nTo the extent there is any loss of innocent life, ever, let me be clear that I consider that tragic. Every life, whether American or Iraqi, is precious.

See images of Jackson fans from around the globe \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"I am still in denial,\" said Jenny Keme, 21. \"We're going to stay here to the end of the ceremony even though it's pouring.

Without Michael Jackson breaking barriers, Barack Obama would never have made it.\"  Elsewhere in London the cast of musical \"Thriller- Live\" paid their own tribute during the evening performance at the Lyric Theatre, with cast, crew and audience observing a minute's silence. \"Many of them were in tears during it,\" reported CNN's Phil Black.\r\n\r\nThe theater has become a shrine to Jackson, with devoted followers holding vigils and leaving cards and messages at the building's entrance.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, meanwhile, hundreds of fans gathered at a Tower Records store -- where Jackson twice visited -- in Tokyo to watch his videos on a big screen.

Morons. @MarkZuckerbergF? Are you listening?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFacebook did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the incident.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Tuesday, his Facebook page, with \"Salman\" as his first name, appeared to have been reactivated by the social network.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie rose to international notoriety in the 1980s after his novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" stirred protests throughout the Muslim world. The Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran issued a fatwa against Rushdie because of the book.\r\r\n\r\r\nHis recent tussle raises issues with Facebook's policy of requiring people to use their real names when registering with the social network. People who don't use their real names are found to be out of compliance with Facebook's rules and can have their accounts deactivated.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way,\" Facebook's terms of service document says.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie's situation shows how difficult it can be for people to prove who they are. He submitted his passport to Facebook, he wrote, and still had problems.\r\r\n\r\r\nSupporters of democratic protests in the Middle East and elsewhere have criticized Facebook and other social networks like Google+ for their real-name policies, saying they prevent people from organizing against authoritarian governments that could use a network like Facebook to crack down.\r\r\n\r\r\nIf they could use pseudonyms, they would be safer, some say.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There are myriad reasons why individuals may wish to use a name other than the one they were born with,\" Jillian York wrote on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's blog in July. \"They may be concerned about threats to their lives or livelihoods, or they may risk political or economic retribution. They may wish to prevent discrimination or they may use a name that's easier to pronounce or spell in a given culture.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFacebook always has maintained its position as an \"identity network.\" A core philosophy of the site is that people should be themselves -- and should be accountable for their posts with their real names.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie's case shows how tricky enforcement can be, though.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is the sort of thing that makes you wonder what real names policy is all about,\" Alexis Madrigal wrote on The Atlantic's website. He added: \"Seriously, what is the point of forcing Salman Rushdie to go by Ahmed Rushdie?

He quickly corrected himself.\n\n\"And with gasoline running at more than $4 a barrel ... a gallon ... I wish ... $4 a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians,\" he said.\n\n\"We have proven oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the United States. But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production. And I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use.\"\n\nMcCain's plan would let individual states decide whether to explore drilling possibilities.  Watch a McCain adviser describe the proposal \u00bb\n\nThe proposal could put McCain at odds with environmentalists who say it is incongruous with his plans to combat global warning. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a McCain ally, opposes offshore drilling.\n\nFlorida Gov. Charlie Crist had expressed opposition to exploring coastal waters, but he said this week he supports McCain's plan to lift the moratorium and would not rule out letting his state choose to drill offshore.\n\n\"It's the last thing in the world I'd like to do, but I also understand what people are paying at the pump, and I understand the drag it is on our economy,\" Crist told the St. Petersburg Times. \"Something has to be done in a responsible, pragmatic way.\"\n\nThe current law, which has been in effect since 1981, covers most of the country's coastal waters.\n\nMany officials from coastal states oppose offshore drilling because of the risk of oil spills. Environmentalists want offshore drilling to stop to protect oceans and beaches from further pollution.\n\n\"The next president must be willing to break with the energy policies, not just of the current administration, but the administrations that preceded it, and lead a great national campaign to achieve energy security for America,\" McCain said Tuesday.\n\nMcCain on Monday said incentives could possibly be provided for states that choose to permit exploration off their coasts, adding that \"exploration is a step toward the longer-term goal.\"\n\nTuesday's discussion marks the first in a series of talks about America's energy security that McCain will hold during the next two weeks as he lays out his plan to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.\n\nMcCain opposes drilling in some parts of the wilderness and says those areas must be left undisturbed.\n\n\"When America set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we called it a 'refuge' for a reason,\" he said.\n\nMcCain also criticized the energy policy of Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama.\n\n\"He says that high oil prices are not the problem, but only that they rose too quickly. He doesn't support new domestic production. He doesn't support new nuclear plants. He doesn't support more traditional use of coal, either,\" McCain said.\n\n\"So what does Sen. Obama support in energy policy? Well, for starters, he supported the energy bill of 2005 -- a grab bag of corporate favors that I opposed. And now he supports new taxes on energy producers. He wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas. If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea too -- and a lot of good it did us.\"\n\nMcCain argues that a windfall profits tax will only increase the country's dependence on foreign oil and be an obstacle to domestic exploration.\n\n\"I'm all for recycling -- but it's better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s,\" he said.\n\nObama on Tuesday blasted McCain for changing his stance on offshore drilling", "3069": "cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov", "3070": "$100 billion", "3071": "San Salvador.\r\n\r\nFunes, elected March 15, is a member of a political party that waged guerrilla war against the government 17 years ago.

French intelligence officials were also aware of the facility for several months at least, a U.S. diplomatic source said.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt wasn't until Monday that Iran wrote a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency, revealing the existence of the underground facility on a military base near the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe facility is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges, which is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor but is sufficient to manufacture bomb-making material, according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter.\r\r\n\r\r\nIran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site, an agency spokesman said.\r\r\n\r\r\nOnce Iran alerted the IAEA, Obama began sharing U.S. intelligence on the nuclear site with allies, particularly with Russia and China in an effort to get those countries on board with new sanctions against Iran, the officials said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Friday that Iran admitted the existence of the \"new pilot fuel enrichment plant,\" prompting Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to respond at the G-20 economic summit.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the nonproliferation regime,\" Obama said, with Brown and Sarkozy standing at his side.

Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France", "3265": "Jose Mourinho", "3266": "The Liberty Sun, a U.S.-flagged  cargo ship, but were unable to board.\r\n\r\nPhilip Shapiro, head of Liberty Maritime Corp., told a U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee that the owners of U.S.-flagged \"have done all they can within the law to protect our crews.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he said, U.S. vessels are still largely at the mercy of pirates in shipping lanes around the heavily trafficked Gulf of Aden.\r\n\r\n\"In light of the recent threats to U.S. merchant mariners, we respectfully request that Congress consider clearing the obstacles that currently block ship owners from arming our vessels,\" Shapiro said.\r\n\r\nPirates unsuccessfully attempted to board the Liberty Sun", "3267": "marble", "3268": "the Nobel speech", "3269": "a two-day summit", "3270": "The game's storyline follows the path of \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" the T.E. Lawrence book that inspired the epic movie \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" Amy Henning, the writer for the \"Uncharted\" series, pulls elements from Lawrence's book and weaves them into a stunning narrative about Nathan's search for a lost city called Iram of the Pillars.\r\r\n\r\r\nKeith Guerrette, lead visual effects artist from Naughty Dog, said Henning really opened up the characters in the game and delves deeply into Nathan's past as well as his connections to his companions. While some of the story is told in flashbacks, it never feels disjointed or out of place and flows with the action in the game.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe pace, for the most part, is quick and occurs over several different types of environments. From a vast desert to historical chateaus, the scenes are beautifully rendered and help deepen the moment. There were a couple of missions that bogged down the story in places, but those were few and far between.\r\r\n\r\r\nMany times, I felt like I was in an \"Indiana Jones\" movie. There were moments when the gameplay was very similar to what I've seen on the big screen. For example, one mission had me chasing after a caravan transporting my longtime friend, Victor Sullivan, through a narrow cavern in a scene that was reminiscent of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nLike Dr. Jones, Nathan has to solve puzzles and use his journal to reference solutions. The puzzles were not extremely challenging once the clues in the journal were deciphered. There are other little touches that are Jones-esque, but they add to the story rather than taking away from it. The action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe dialogue helps keep the mood light as character banter flows naturally and feels like what it is -- conversations between people who don't take themselves too seriously but have experienced life-changing events. There is humor, caring, concern and sarcasm that one would expect from longtime friends. It feels natural and gets the player emotionally involved.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We've been building up to this one,\" Guerrette said. \"We went in thinking, 'How can we take our tech and art and make them even better?' \"\r\r\n\r\r\nThere are subtle effects in the environment, like shadows from a fire, ripples in water and disappearing footprints in sand. But the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which Nathan takes on his enemies while the background moves.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuch of Nathan's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings, like the \"Assassin's Creed\" games. That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe game's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times. Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles. Melee was improved (I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory.\r\r\n\r\r\nStealth has become a more effective tool in some missions. There was one mission, however, where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill. It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance.\r\r\n\r\r\nTargeting specific areas on enemies also didn't seem to matter. There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down. Yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy's arm to get him to collapse.\r\r\n\r\r\nNathan can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way. The audio is funny, but the effects are devastating.\r\r\n\r\r\nA split-screen co-op version (a fan request) offers a unique story with the chance to unlock multiplayer bonuses and skills. This version can be played either on or offline.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe multiplayer version also features improved cinematic techniques, boosters and the ability to upload great (or not-so-great) gameplay moments into social media platforms. A buddy system can be used for cooperative play in multiplayer mode, or you can go it alone during competitive play.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Uncharted 3\" is an outstanding adventure game that gives you a feature-film feeling. The environments are open and interactive. The story is unique and fresh. And the characters are portrayed in ways that make them feel real and emotional.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile developers wouldn't say if this was the final act for Nathan Drake, there are moments", "3271": "James Callaghan", "3272": "23", "3273": "2009", "3274": "Tower Records", "3275": "Huntelaar", "3276": "IQ and leadership", "3277": "FIFA president Sepp Blatter has unveiled a raft of reforms aimed at restoring credibility to world football's ruling body", "3278": "anthems", "3279": "Stuttgart", "3280": "The passion awakened in Republicans could put Democrats at a disadvantage as the midterm elections near, experts say", "3281": "3-D street level view", "3282": "the families, Calderon and local political and civic leaders", "3283": "Republican", "3284": "4 a.m.", "3285": "Vermicomposting is the art of composting using worms -- and it is worms, apparently, who could save us yet.\r\n\r\nWorms are nature's waste disposal units. Or rather, it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units, as they don't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful: nutrient-rich compost.\r\n\r\nEarthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly, in this context: The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus, which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting, according to CityFarmer.org. Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day, but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process, according to The Ecologist.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of them, too. You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land, according to NatureWatch, their population doubling in size every one-two months. And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves, stems and dead roots in one year, ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process.\r\n\r\nWhat they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients. According to NatureWatch, earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen, seven times as much phosphorous, 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more \"beneficial bacteria\" than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place. Literally speaking, what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out.\r\n\r\nUtilizing 'black gold'\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise why these worms' byproducts are often referred to as \"black gold,\" this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world's agricultural soil has become \"seriously degraded,\" according to the UK Soil Association.\r\n\r\nWorm compost:\r\n\r\nJust one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days, according to ScienceDaily. And plants love it. Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting, by as much as 40 percent for broccoli, 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots, according to The Ecologist.\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Waste Survey, compiled by Veolia Environmental Services, we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004. And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted. Around 32 percent of the European Union's annual municipal waste (around 120 million tons) is food and garden waste, according to Waste Management World. And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill, emitting methane into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste, vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places. In Hong Kong, none other than fast-food chain McDonald's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day, according to the Reuters news service. McDonald's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to Hong Kong's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent, Reuters reports.\r\n\r\nOther companies to have experimented with worm composting include Ikea in the U.S. state of Illinois, where, according to Treehugger.com, it is conducting vermicomposting trials. If all goes well, it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent, the site says.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, we have had this knowledge for centuries. Aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the \"intestines of the soil,\" according to The New York Times, which also points out that Cleopatra was another devotee, bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected. Charles Darwin admired their land-tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them. \"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures,\" he mused, according to The New York Times.\r\n\r\nGreenhouse gas emitters\r\n\r\nWhat Darwin, Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however, is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste.\r\n\r\nScientists in India have found that worms' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure. According to the Indian newspaper, India Together, researchers in Gujarat have found that worms can \"detox\" the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste.\r\n\r\nThe method is ideal for industries -- such as paper, food processing, oil, textiles, dairy, distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge, Indian researchers say.\r\n\r\nBut even with vermicomposting, something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around, there's a downside -- and it's a rather large one.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Ray Odierno, issued a joint statement expressing sadness over al-Hakim's death and describing him as \"a national leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,\" the statement said. \"We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.\"  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future \u00bb\r\n\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered his condolences, saying al-Hakim was \"like an old brother.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Maliki credited him for being a \"strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq.\"\r\n\r\n\"His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,\" al-Maliki said in the statement.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim ended his more than 20-year exile in Iran in 2003, when he returned to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his regime.\r\n\r\n\"It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,\" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. \"I was longing to see them. My goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them.\"\r\n\r\nIraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return.\r\n\r\nDuring his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHe took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south.\r\n\r\nSCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word \"revolution,\" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man.\r\n\r\nHis political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did.\r\n\r\nGovernment ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad.\r\n\r\nAnd when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence", "3346": "itchy and red eyes and hyper-pigmentation", "3347": "Holocaust deniers", "3348": "1-0", "3349": "Dunkin' Donuts", "3350": "EEG to find out what parts of the brain", "3351": "Clark Howard, the Atlanta-based host of a nationally syndicated radio show, will be host of a new television show designed to help viewers save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times. \"Clark Howard\" debuts on HLN January 3.

It's not a museum. It's just private land, still with shadows of its past.\r\r\n\r\r\nFriendfield's most distinctive historical feature, perhaps, is the dirt road known as Slave Street.  Stroll across the plantation with CNN's Joe Johns \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nSix white-washed little shacks are all that remain of the slave quarters, even though rows of these houses once stood on the property. About 350 slaves lived here during the 19th century.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe houses are nothing special -- no plumbing, of course. The wooden walls are paper thin in places. It would have been hot and humid in summer, and most certainly cold in winter, although the shacks had fireplaces.\r\r\n\r\r\nThey would have been crowded: probably one or two families living in a space smaller than a modern-day garage.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe White House is some 472 miles from Georgetown, South Carolina. But long before Michelle Obama was born, her great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, likely toiled in the fields here six days a week, from sunup to sundown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe place he probably called home was a little white shack smaller than -- by comparison -- a Secret Service security shed on the grounds of the executive mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\r\r\n\r\r\nAll told, hundreds of people lived like this, on this one plantation alone.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Anywhere between 200 to 500 at different times,\" said Ed Carter, the property manager. \"The older the plantation got, they kept adding on more cabins. [Some] cabins are 1847.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There was some on the other street that were about probably 1820s.

If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain", "3689": "SARGODA, Pakistan (CNN) -- Mohammed Iqbal said he has been told by his landlord to pay up on debts and is left with a choice facing others in this impoverished corner of Pakistan: Sell your children or a kidney.\r\n\r\nThis man's landlord forced him to pay off money he borrowed for his children's medical bills.\r\n\r\nFor the 50-year-old Iqbal, there is only one option.

A series of exercises, lectures, and meditations stretched over 10 months, Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people's lives.\r\n\r\nLike some participants, Joan, who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at Spirit Rock, initially balked at the idea of singing. \"I thought James wanted me to join a choir,\" she says, \"but I took it on faith that the singing was going to work.\" So she started trilling along with the \"Hairspray\" soundtrack while driving. \"It seemed ridiculous, but that's what initially helped me the most.\"\r\n\r\n\"The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being,\" says Baraz. \"In other words, it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good.\" The first and most important step, he says, is intention: making the decision to be happy.\r\n\r\nRobert Holden, Ph.D., author of \"Happiness Now! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast\" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. \"Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow. For centuries, optimists and pessimists have argued over who's right, and the answer is they both are; each sees what they're looking for. If you focus on happiness, that's what you become more aware of.\"\r\n\r\nOnce participants have made up their minds to be happier, Baraz gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in Berkeley and in twice-monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind.

However, in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe murky story began in June of this year, when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena, Italy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren's chief designer Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan's wife, Trudy Coughlan, had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren's Woking headquarters. An employee of the copy shop, suspicious that confidential data was being copied, blew the whistle to Ferrari.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney, a friend and former colleague of Coughlan's (the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s). Stepney had been the team's chief mechanic, but in February took his new role as the team's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena, Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari issued the following press statement:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal, concerning the theft of technical information. Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut now the FIA is in possession of new evidence. Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso. On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa, Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated: \"The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession, or that such drivers have recently been in possession, of written evidence relevant to this investigation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe letter continued: \"I can confirm, given the importance of this issue, that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the International Sporting Code or the Formula One regulations. However, in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information, serious consequences could follow.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFive days later the WMSC announced it was to reconvene \"following the emergence of new evidence\", in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa in practice leading up to the Monaco Grand Prix. Stepney has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther drama overshadowed Alonso and Hamilton's one-two on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. Modena's public prosecutor, Giuseppe Tibis, issued a legal notice -- known as an 'avviso di garanzia' -- that six McLaren employees were under criminal investigation . The six included McLaren supremo Ron Dennis, managing directors Martin Whitmarsh and Jonathan Neale, technical director Jonathan Neale and designer Rob Taylor as well as Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis outcome has put a dark shadow McLaren's return to winning ways. The team, dominant in the late 1990s, had struggled with reliability for some years. But the team is not taking the decision lying down. Martin Whitmarsh, COO of the McLaren Group said: \"We believe we have got the grounds for an appeal", "3793": "he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, this country's highest civilian honor", "3794": "at least 90", "3795": "300,000", "3796": "the history of American racism", "3797": "Hundreds", "3798": "fear of their calls being traced", "3799": "foreign language", "3800": "Gloria Macapagal Arroyo", "3801": "raped the 13-year-old victim", "3802": "progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy", "3803": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The doctor at the center of an investigation into patients' deaths after Hurricane Katrina said everyone must remember the \"magnitude of human suffering\" after the storm to ensure that no health care worker is ever \"falsely accused in a rush to judgment.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Anna Pou", "3804": "the officer hospitalized after being stabbed", "3805": "The tests", "3806": "nearly 200,000", "3807": "Nashville, Tennessee, hotel", "3808": "runner Gilbert Tuhabonye", "3809": "21-square-foot room", "3810": "help restore the leadership the Congo needs", "3811": "dollars and improve Medicaid patients' health? We can achieve both if we are willing to consider an unorthodox solution: Pay Medicaid recipients who are smokers to quit using cigarettes.\r\r\n\r\r\nThirty-three percent of the Medicaid population smokes, compared with 20% of the U.S. population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Evidence of the dangers of smoking, coupled with smoking bans and steep tobacco taxes, has cut the smoking rate in half for the overall U.S. population over the past 50 years. Now, it is widely acknowledged that smoking is largely isolated in vulnerable populations.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhy don't Medicaid smokers quit in response to policies that are effective for others? One reason is that investing in preventive health care is difficult when you live month-to-month. But an indulgence the poor really can't afford is cigarettes. Smoking is expensive. A pack-a-day smoker could save more than $2,000 per year by quitting.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow would the proposed incentive system work? Smokers on Medicaid would receive small payments in return for quitting or getting cessation counseling as a step toward quitting. Participants would have to hold up their end of the bargain. They would get paid only if medical claims data indicated that they were getting counseling or they tested to be smoke-free. Tests can easily be conducted using breathalyzers to measure carbon monoxide levels.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt may seem implausible that such a limited compensation could push anyone to quit a practice as addictive as cigarette smoking, but there is solid evidence that it works. Research on addiction has repeatedly demonstrated that small payments have persuaded even cocaine addicts to stop using. Furthermore, in my research, I have found that the financial motivation to quit is more effective for low-income smokers than a motivation based on health concerns.\r\r\n\r\r\nSmall payments can be effective by providing tangible, immediate and clear-cut gains.\r\r\n\r\r\nTaxpayers would have a lot to gain from this approach, too. Medical care for tobacco-related diseases costs Medicaid an estimated $22 billion every year. Treating the many illnesses associated with smoking -- emphysema, coronary heart disease and lung cancer, to name a few -- is expensive. Pregnant smokers risk premature childbirth and often expensive medical treatment for their newborns.\r\r\n\r\r\nSensible as they are, incentive payments to smokers on Medicaid face many obstacles before they can be adopted by the federal government.\r\r\n\r\r\nMany people, including politicians, will chafe at paying people to do something they ought to do on their own. Smoking carries the taint of a moral vice, a bad habit that should require no incentive to abandon.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut providing incentives to promote positive behaviors is a common practice and often uncontroversial. Employers and life insurers, for example, increasingly provide financial incentives to stop smoking. They consider these incentives good investments. Paying such incentives could both improve health for the poor and lower Medicaid", "3812": "2", "3813": "A new book", "3814": "half a dozen", "3815": "The young girl", "3816": "20", "3817": "Al-Jazeera English correspondent", "3818": "the Chinese Delegation", "3819": "The White House position on extraterrestrials is now clear: aliens haven't contacted Earth, but that doesn't mean the U.S. government isn't looking for them.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race,\" wrote Phil Larson of the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy", "3820": "electro-favoring fellow Swedes", "3821": "Petters Group Worldwide", "3822": "the opposition party leader", "3823": "Capitol Hill", "3824": "two cakes at a time.

They were taken to area hospitals.\r\n\r\nHours later, local television reported a car bombing in north Jakarta, but that report was immediately contradicted by various other media sources.\r\n\r\nPolice sealed off the area around both hotel blasts, one in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and the other at the J.W.

See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research \u00bb\r\n\r\nResearchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body.

Watch a doctor explain why embryotic stem cells are so important \u00bb\r\n\r\nWhen the embryo is 4 or 5 days old, scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish.

I do know that in the work that I do and my wife does as the chair of America's Promise, we are seeing more and more people step forward to try to deal with the problems that we have, to include African-Americans and Hispanics stepping forward.\r\n\r\nBut it's not just a one-time thing. You can't just have, let's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday or a day of service. We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year.\r\n\r\nWe need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ... But without that kind of family support, then we need Boys and Girls Clubs. We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We need mentors. Otherwise, these kids will find bad adults to copy from, and we're going to lose them.\r\n\r\nLemon: I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me.\r\n\r\nLemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort?\r\n\r\nPowell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe've got to teach them that you've got to behave. You've got to learn what it means to \"mind\" somebody. You've got to read to your kids. You've got to act like responsible fathers.\r\n\r\nLemon: How did you become involved in President Obama's Renew America Together initiative, and what is your role?\r\n\r\nPowell: The president-elect was aware of the work that Alma and I had done together on America's Promise.

I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's ahead of us?\r\n\r\nAlexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ...\r\n\r\nThe larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better.\r\n\r\nCNN: Can poetry help in that regard?\r\n\r\nAlexander: I do believe that it can. The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful, because after all if we can't be precise with language, how can we share ideas? Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions. You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem, but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it, those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems.\r\n\r\nCNN: So you're going to write a poem about health care?\r\n\r\nAlexander: That would be fun. Of course, this [poem for the inauguration] is an occasional poem, it has to serve the moment, it has to serve the day, right? So those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day. But of course, what I hope to do, rather than the laundry list poem, is to find language that will hopefully have a little resonance after the day is done.\r\n\r\nCNN: Will you show it to anybody before you read it?\r\n\r\nAlexander: I show it to my husband [artist Ficre Ghebreyesus] , and he is my first", "4480": "The U.N.", "4481": "80,000", "4482": "David Wilhelm, a federal customs agent", "4483": "President Obama", "4484": "12,000", "4485": "Twitter", "4486": "The story was broken by the National Enquirer", "4487": "Elvis Presley.

Countless people from all over the world make pilgrimages to their burial sites, hoping to draw close to those they adored from afar.\r\n\r\nNow Michael Jackson's gravesite will become the next holy grail.\r\n\r\nA private gathering for the pop icon was held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California. Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where.\r\n\r\nOfficials at Forest Lawn won't disclose where Jackson's body is being buried. If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months.\r\n\r\nThere has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch.\r\n\r\nIf a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite.\r\n\r\n\"If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,\" said Steve Goldstein, author of L.A.'s Gravesite Companion: Where the VIP's RIP. \"He'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over Marilyn.\"\r\n\r\nFame follows celebrities in life and in death.\r\n\r\n\"There's always a fascination with celebrities, but it's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses,\" says Jim Tipton, founder of findagrave.com, a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens. \"But once they are interred into the ground, anyone who wants to go can go.\"\r\n\r\nTipton's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago, when he saw mobster Al Capone's grave in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. He and many others who are avid about visiting celebrity and historical graves dub themselves \"grave hunters.\"\r\n\r\nThey seek the dead for various reasons. Some go out of simple curiosity. Others are history lovers. Many are fans who deeply admired the stars.

There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before.\r\n\r\nBut even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal?\r\n\r\nTo shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCNN: Has being openly gay affected your career?\r\n\r\nBatt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles \u00bb\r\n\r\nCNN: When did you come out?\r\n\r\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\r\n\r\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go.

At 3,500, millions of specimens of a new, purple-spotted sea anemone. At 4,000 meters, a single never-before-seen carnivorous sea squirt with a funnel-shaped body that snapped shut like a Venus flytrap around any shrimp unfortunate enough to brush against it.\r\n\r\nBack on land, the three new species (the anemone, the sea squirt, and a new kind of barnacle) have drawn the most attention, but it's the team's coral collection, some 10,000 pieces of it, that can tell us about the history of our climate and, perhaps, its future.\r\n\r\nA coral skeleton acts as a tape recorder of its environment. As it grows, the coral's chemical structure (specifically the weight of its oxygen molecules) varies depending on the temperature of the water around it. And, because the coral's uranium decays into thorium over time, it is conveniently datable.\r\n\r\nBy charting different corals' ages and oxygen weights, researchers can map the ocean's changing temperature. During the coming months, expedition scientists will compare 40,000 years of oceanic and atmospheric records.\r\n\r\nThe ocean's temperature and carbon dioxide levels are important because of their impact on our atmosphere. The watery part of the world absorbs and stores sixty times more CO2 than the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHuge reservoirs of the ocean's CO2 lurk in its coldest, densest waters (found in the Tasman Fracture and off Greenland). Because cold water releases more CO2 into the air than warm water, the rate at which bottom water rises to the surface has a profound effect on the atmosphere above.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, we had assumed that our climate was relatively stable.

The incident on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, helped dash the youngest Kennedy brother's chances at the Oval Office in 1972 and 1980.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was more forgiving than the rest of the nation, however, backing Kennedy by a 3-to-2 margin in his 1970 bid to keep his Senate seat. That his brothers, John and Robert, had been assassinated in recent years may have been a factor, experts said.

A judge suspended his two-month jail sentence.\r\n\r\nCritics saw the plea as an attempt to stifle details that would have emerged during a trial.\r\n\r\nIn a display of the senator's legendary oratory, he delivered a nationally televised explanation and apology, saying it was \"indefensible\" that he hadn't called police until the day after the accident.  See how Chappaquiddick fit into Kennedy's legacy \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"If at any time, the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character or his ability, with or without justification, he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duty and should not continue in office,\" Kennedy said.\r\n\r\nJim Baughman, author of \"The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America since 1941,\" said he recalls Kennedy's address being \"less an explanation to the country than to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nThe nation's response was tepid. According to a Time-Harris poll in August 1969, about 44 percent of respondents said Kennedy failed \"to tell the real truth,\" 51 percent said his explanation was inadequate and 77 percent said he was wrong not to report the accident immediately.\r\n\r\nHowever, 58 percent of respondents said \"he has suffered, been punished and should be given the benefit of the doubt.\"  Watch a timeline of Kennedy's tragedies, triumphs \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"I think the national repercussions would have been more severe [today],\" Baughman said.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, the national media were dominated by three TV networks and a handful of magazines and newspapers. New media and talk radio would be a \"much more ferocious force\" today, he said.\r\n\r\nMedia reports from the time indicate few mysteries were solved by Kennedy's address.\r\n\r\nThen-Edgartown Police Chief Jim Arena was often lambasted for his handling of the case. He said Thursday he would handle it no differently today except that he would charge Kennedy with vehicular homicide, a charge that did not exist in 1969.\r\n\r\n\"I will always contend that what happened that night was an accident. What happened afterward has never been completely explained,\" said Arena, who is now 79.\r\n\r\nIn his national address, Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to a ferry landing because she was tired. He denied \"widely circulated suspicions of immoral conduct\" and also refuted reports that he was \"driving under the influence of liquor.\"  Watch Kennedy's explanation \u00bb\r\n\r\nKennedy said his unfamiliarity with the bridge, which had no guardrails and met the road at an awkward angle, caused him to drive off the side and into Poucha Pond.\r\n\r\n\"The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water,\" Kennedy said. \"Water entered my lungs and I actually felt the sensation of drowning, but somehow I struggled to the surface alive.\"\r\n\r\nKopechne did not. Kennedy said he dived back into the water several times, \"but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion and alarm.\"\r\n\r\nConceding he did not seek a telephone, Kennedy said he returned to the party and summoned a cousin and friend to the scene. They, too, failed in saving Kopechne, he said.\r\n\r\n\"All kinds of scrambled thoughts -- all of them confused, some of them irrational, many of them which I cannot recall, and some of which I would not have seriously entertained under normal circumstances -- went through my mind during this period,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe asked to be taken to the ferry slip, he said, where he jumped into the water, swam the 500-foot channel back to Edgartown, returned to his hotel room and collapsed.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until morning that he called police, and then, only after he called legal adviser Burke Marshall, he said.\r\n\r\nThe media clamored with questions: Why had Kopechne left her purse and room key at the cottage and told no one she was going home? How did Kennedy get lost on a one-turn trip to the ferry? Was the ferry operating when Kennedy and Kopechne left?\r\n\r\n\"The larger anger about it was the 10-hour lag [in reporting the accident], that he was more concerned about his reputation than this young woman's life,\" Baughman said. \"He didn't take enough time to blame himself and take responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nToday, Baughman said, Kennedy could still survive a Chappaquiddick -- largely because of the Kennedys' clout and because Massachusetts is so enamored with the family -- but it would be tougher with the Slate.coms and Drudge Reports of the world hounding him.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington University's Arterton concurs that, like Jesse Helms' North Carolina or Strom Thurmond's South Carolina, Massachusetts would likely forgive one of its favorite sons today.\r\n\r\nIf Kennedy survived his first re-election, as he did in 1970, he likely would have prevailed in later ones, though it would have been \"very, very difficult to remain in office,\" Arterton said. He also doubts Kennedy would have been able to isolate himself with advisers for days without making a statement.  Watch a newsreel of Kennedy's early years \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"In the cable news era, that would not have been possible,\" he said, explaining that blogs and other new media would have prodded the networks and newspapers. \"There would have been much more effort to dig into that story nationally.\"\r\n\r\nAt the least, Baughman said, \"you'd have maybe a more diverse conversation about Kennedy's culpability and judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThen-Chief Arena remembers the intense criticism of his investigation from his own counterparts.\r\n\r\nDiver John Farrar", "4587": "Melissa Harris-Lacewell", "4588": "the child stars", "4589": "Justin Barker", "4590": "use fake blood", "4591": "radiologist failed to highlight the growth of a cancerous tumor on the donor lungs", "4592": "Tohoku Electric's Onagawa plant, the Sendai-based utility and NISA reported Friday", "4593": "Would You Be My Bride", "4594": "Escalante", "4595": "an album that's a veritable parade of Songs of the Summer", "4596": "Burundi", "4597": "Florida's Gulf Coast", "4598": "about one out of every 150", "4599": "EW.com) -- Kelly Clarkson", "4600": "Manny Pacquiao", "4601": "southern Iceland", "4602": "Laura Zuniga and seven men", "4603": "The night", "4604": "21-square-foot room while she lived aboard a circus train.\n\nBungee cords crisscrossed her walls once a week to prevent an avalanche of items from raining down.

According to Iraq's Interior Ministry, 969 civilians died and 1,750 were wounded during April. In March, the total was 923 civilians killed and 1,358 wounded -- a sharp increase over February, when 633 died and 701 were wounded.\r\n\r\nDespite Shiite militants' calls for the Iraqi government to honor a cease-fire, al-Sheikhly said, the crackdown on insurgents will end when the insurgency ends.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there is a timetable for all this. I can't tell that this will end tomorrow or the day after,\" he said. The attacks \"will end when those aspects of violence end.\"\r\n\r\nHe echoed sentiments expressed earlier in the day by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who said the government will not accept the existence of a nongovernment armed force.\r\n\r\nWord of the casualties came as the U.S. military said its highest death toll in seven months reflected an effort by Iraqi militants to reassert themselves after weeks of government crackdowns.

F--- them,\" she allegedly said as her husband, Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, bandied about a scheme to withhold state funds from the Cubs' parent Tribune Company unless the owner agreed to fire certain Chicago Tribune employees.\n\nSeven days later, according to the affidavit, she took part in a meeting about whether President-elect Barack Obama would secure a lucrative job for her if her husband appointed Obama's preferred candidate to his vacant Senate seat.\n\nU.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has said Patricia Blagojevich is not the target of the investigation of the governor's alleged attempts to sell Obama's Senate seat, pressure the Chicago Tribune and threaten to withdraw funding from a children's hospital.  Watch what prosecutors say was the first lady's role in alleged scandal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nA glance at her profile on the governor's Web site details a list of philanthropic endeavors, including awareness campaigns for breast cancer, heart disease and food allergies. She also has championed children's health care and literacy, and has parlayed her love for gardening into the State Beautification Initiative.\n\n\"As first lady, she works hard to promote initiatives that will help the families of Illinois bring up happy, healthy and successful children,\" her biography says.\n\nBlagojevich and her family have been part of the Chicago machine for decades. The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko", "4808": "Iraq", "4809": "your services, your family", "4810": "his ankle is still a little swollen", "4811": "14", "4812": "an emotional Kiley Barnes", "4813": "100 yards", "4814": "producers.\r\n\r\nThe production is set to open December 13 at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York's theater district", "4815": "digital networks", "4816": "Nebraska", "4817": "The 500-year-old painting", "4818": "sick with worry", "4819": "Twelve of the Billingses' 16", "4820": "the Jackson 5", "4821": "felony conspiracy counts", "4822": "in a hail of bullets", "4823": "FMLN", "4824": "February 13, 2009", "4825": "the breakdown of law and order", "4826": "the Scottish 48-year-old's alleged \"four-letter tantrum\" earlier this week had influenced millions of viewers to switch their votes to dance act Diversity.\r\n\r\nThe buildup to Saturday night's live final had been dominated by reports that Boyle", "4827": "abuse", "4828": "the officer hospitalized", "4829": "Pay Medicaid recipients who are smokers to quit using cigarettes", "4830": "Manchester United and England striker", "4831": "silver", "4832": "Turkish Arab family", "4833": "Michael Jackson", "4834": "water waste by 10 million gallons or more over the next year.\r\n\r\nWyland and his team kicked off their campaign at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta on October 7.

But the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which Nathan takes on his enemies while the background moves.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuch of Nathan's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings, like the \"Assassin's Creed\" games. That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe game's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times. Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles. Melee was improved (I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory.\r\r\n\r\r\nStealth has become a more effective tool in some missions. There was one mission, however, where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill. It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance.\r\r\n\r\r\nTargeting specific areas on enemies also didn't seem to matter. There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down. Yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy's arm to get him to collapse.\r\r\n\r\r\nNathan can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way.

Watch explanation for mistaken release \u00bb\r\n\r\nAn investigation is under way to find out how the error happened, he added.\r\n\r\nOlson had served about six years behind bars for her role in incidents in 1975: the attempted bombing of two police cars and the shooting death of a customer during a bank robbery.\r\n\r\nProsecutors said she was part of an SLA plot to murder Los Angeles police officers by planting bombs under their squad cars.\r\n\r\nOne of the cars was parked outside a crowded Hollywood restaurant. The bombs did not go off, and no one was hurt.\r\n\r\nThe SLA is best known for its 1974 kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.\r\n\r\nA parole board hearing in 2004 reduced the sentence related to the attempted bombing charge, but \"an administrative error failed to take into account\" the second-degree murder charge for the shooting death, Kernan said.\r\n\r\nDavid Nickerson, one of Olson's attorneys, said he and co-counsel Shawn Chapman Holley intend to file a petition with Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday.\r\n\r\nOlson cannot be treated as \"yo-yo\" in regard to the law, he said.\r\n\r\nChapman Holley called her return to custody \"ridiculous.\" \"It's like they make up all new rules when it comes to her,\" Chapman Holley told The Associated Press. \"It's like we are in some kind of fascist state.\"\r\n\r\nThe administrative error was verified late Saturday morning, Kernan said, after a thorough review of Olson's case. He said \"concerns\" about her release date prompted the review.\r\n\r\nOlson was taken into custody at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday night, Kernan said.\r\n\r\nOlson had been granted interstate parole and was on her way to Minnesota, where she lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999, Nickerson had said.\r\n\r\nFrom the Los Angeles airport, authorities took Olson to her home in Palmdale, California, where she remained until she was arrested midday Saturday, when the review was completed, Kernan said.\r\n\r\nOriginally named Kathleen Soliah, Olson fled California after authorities began looking for her and then changed her name and lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999 in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nShe had married and was raising three daughters.\r\n\r\nMany residents rallied to Olson's cause and helped post bail for her.\r\n\r\nBut one group in California, the Los Angeles Police Protective League", "4990": "Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Chile marks three days", "4991": "Christian Horner", "4992": "Polidori", "4993": "two", "4994": "the movie", "4995": "serious condition", "4996": "Dragonball", "4997": "John Kiriakou", "4998": "Italian", "4999": "dance moves, his look and his sound", "5000": "reportedly carried out an 18-day hunger strike", "5001": "rioters", "5002": "Anderson", "5003": "infant bottles", "5004": "seven", "5005": "met with a ghost writer for a book.\r\n\r\nJeffrey Czech also confirmed details of a \"less-intrusive\" reality show about Suleman and her 14 kids, although no U.S. network has been signed to carry it.\r\n\r\nThe advance money for the TV show deal will help Suleman pay her bills, Czech said.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, she needs to do something more than just flip hamburgers all day,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSuleman was set to sign an agreement with a ghost writer for her book Monday, Czech said.\r\n\r\nWhile he would not name the writer, he said the two \"hit it off.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the eight children born this year, Suleman has six other children.
