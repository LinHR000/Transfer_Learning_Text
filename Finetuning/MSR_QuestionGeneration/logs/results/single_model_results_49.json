Not by necessity nor under pressure from another government,\" Donayre said, acording to the Peruvian Andina news agency.\r\n\r\nFurther heightening tensions, Donayre was quoted as saying that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they want at private functions.\r\n\r\n\"I want to express and specify that it was not a speech nor a public act,\" Andina quotes the general as saying. \"The situation in which what happened at a private gathering", "197": "increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company.\r\n\r\nDefterios: If you look at the Middle East, specifically within this Gulf region, it's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership. Is this society in the region ready for this move?\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: Interestingly, the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside. We host 200 nationalities, so for us, the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community. So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path: it's an organic path to continue the openness that exists.\r\n\r\nForeign direct investment is not your own wealth. When you have your own wealth, you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes, because it's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at foreign direct investment, it mandates you to be much more transparent, you have to be very diligent about your work, and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment.\r\n\r\nDefterios: It's interesting, you read the front line of the DP World, P&O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress. What are the lessons, not just from the UAE perspective, but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process?\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: First of all, I think it is important to understand, in this global world, there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere. Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad. We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places.\r\n\r\nDefterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment.\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us. If today I lock up my investment opportunity here, money will not come to me, money will go somewhere else. When I have investment coming from abroad, it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image'.\r\n\r\nSo when I say it, I am not directing this as a message to a particular country. I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation, when it comes to responsibility, when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country. So that's really a lesson that's very very critical.\r\n\r\nDefterios: A number of firsts: the first to start a B2B marketplace; the first female minister within the country, an economy minister; and the first to launch a perfume range as well. What is it all about? Trailblazing, setting examples, being an entrepreneur? How would you describe what you're doing here?\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: Everybody laughs about the perfume. One, I think the United Arab Emirates, since inception (it's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed) has always given equal opportunities for women. But it's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push, and what it is that we can do and not do.\r\n\r\nIn my personal belief you need a bridge, you need a door opener for women.

There are thousands of bikes stashed across the city at bike stations around 300m apart. The first 30 minutes of any trip is free; you'll need a credit card to register with the scheme. Once you've got your bike, you're ready to career around the cobbled streets of Montmartre and rattle along the Seine.\r\n\r\nCaf\u00e9 hotspots The classic Parisian image of smoky cafes is now banished to the pavements, thanks to a smoking ban in bars and restaurants that came in at the end of 2007.

You can't just have, let's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday or a day of service. We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year.\r\n\r\nWe need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ...

Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me.\r\n\r\nLemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort?\r\n\r\nPowell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe've got to teach them that you've got to behave.

She sits quietly or snuggles up to kids as they read her a book. And no, she's not napping, and the kids don't have treats in their pockets. She's actually helping these children learn to read.\r\n\r\nIt sounds implausible. After all, dogs can't read. How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nKathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either.

His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel.\r\n\r\nKatherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966.\r\n\r\nBy that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993.

According to Sharfstein, the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nBisphenol-A is found in many products, but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula, and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys. A handful of states and cities including Minnesota, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, have passed laws in some form banning BPA in products meant for children.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position is a partial reversal of the FDA's declaration in 2008 that BPA has no adverse effects. That announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry-funded research.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince then, the agency says on its Web site, \"recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals. While BPA is not proven to harm children or adults, these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of BPA.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program, which in its own 2008 report said there is \"some concern\" for BPA's effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. Other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the authors of those studies say it's not clear the problems were actually caused by BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt a news conference Friday, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said further research is needed \"to determine if and when further action is needed.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has been allotted $30 million to study the health effects of BPA. Hamburg said that research would likely be complete in 18 to 24 months. In a separate review, the Environmental Protection Agency is weighing whether to list BPA as a chemical of concern under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, which would trigger a formal process to develop possible restrictions on BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt the news conference, Hamburg and Sharfstein urged parents to keep the risk in perspective, saying the benefits of nutritious infant formula outstrip any potential danger from BPA. Other guidance includes:\r\r\n\r\r\n\u2022 Discarding scratched or worn bottles and cups, which aside from harboring germs might also release small amounts of BPA\r\r\n\r\r\n\u2022 Being careful when heating formula, as boiling or very hot liquid might cause the release of BPA into infant formula\r\r\n\r\r\n\u2022 Checking labels to ensure that only microwave-safe products are used in the microwave, and dishwasher-safe products are put in the dishwasher, to avoid leakage\r\r\n\r\r\nIn taking a middle ground, the FDA managed to frustrate both industry and consumer safety groups.\r\r\n\r\r\nSteven Hentges, a scientist with the American Chemistry Council's global study group on BPA, said the guidance would \"confuse consumers,\" while a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council said the move was \"too little, too late.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHentges painted the FDA decision as a victory, saying the announcement reflects scientific consensus", "540": "the vast majority of tablet computers", "541": "Kashmir Wednesday", "542": "looting", "543": "extent of student rights involving searches", "544": "Authorities", "545": "the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front", "546": "Los Angeles, California", "547": "illuminated signs", "548": "more than 4,000 Zimbabweans", "549": "real", "550": "the center two semi-automatic handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9 mm", "551": "Arbeit Macht Frei\" -- \"Work Sets You Free\" in German -- was stolen, according to police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel.\r\n\r\nThe heavy iron sign \"was removed by being unscrewed on one side and pulled off on the other,\" Szczygiel said. \"It is also believed that this was a planned event and that several people were involved as the sign was at remarkable height.\"\r\n\r\nPolice have launched an investigation.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum, called the theft shocking.\r\n\r\n\"While we don't yet know exactly who stole the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an attack on the memory of the Holocaust, and an escalation from those elements that would like to return us to darker days,\" said Avner Shalev.\r\n\r\n\"I call on all enlightened forces in the world -- who fight against anti-semitism, racism, xenophobia and the hatred of the other -- to join together to combat these trends,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMore than 1 million people died in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex; about 90 percent of the victims were Jews.\r\n\r\nRabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, called the sign \"the defining symbol of the Holocaust", "552": "a \"sophisticated and well-coordinated\" attack", "553": "the order", "554": "Monday, October 6, 2008", "555": "Clear Water Bay in the New Territories, Hong Kong", "556": "the club could only fix their choice on a coach of the highest standard to continue the great work already accomplished and the club's development on the playing front", "557": "kids' show host Cerrie Burnell", "558": "Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi", "559": "Christian Bale", "560": "women", "561": "The Food and Drug Administration", "562": "conflict", "563": "$10 one-day fare sale", "564": "iPhone apps", "565": "2005", "566": "1,700 to 5,000", "567": "Chinese dairy products", "568": "Hudson' pilot", "569": "101", "570": "A damaged airplane lies on the ground Saturday next to a busy road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThe pilot reported engine problems shortly after leaving the city's Wiley Post Airport, about a mile away from the crash site, at midmorning, said Lynn Lunsford, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.\r\n\r\nThe plane hit two trees as it came down, and video showed the damaged Beechcraft Bonanza resting on the grass near a busy thoroughfare in the northwest section of the city.\r\n\r\nFire Department Deputy Chief Cecil Clay said the two men and three women on the plane were taken to hospitals.

Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags.\"\r\n\r\nTensions rose over the weekend when Donayre, who is scheduled to retire Friday, was widely quoted in Peru and Chile as saying that he will not be forced to resign early due to external pressure.\r\n\r\n\"I was named commander general under a presidential mandate and I can only be relieved under such an order.

Everyone from Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black and radio personality Rachel Maddow to Joe Solmonese, the president of Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay advocacy group, seem to be blasting Obama for everything from \"don't ask don't tell\" to Adam Lambert not winning American Idol.\r\n\r\nIn their minds, Obama is not moving fast enough on behalf of the GLBT community. The outcry is not completely without merit -- the Justice Department's unnerving brief on the Defense of Marriage Act immediately comes to mind. I was upset by some of the statements, but not surprised. (After the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, President Ronald Reagan's initial handling of AIDS and, more recently, Katrina, there is little that surprises me when it comes to the government and the treatment of its people.)\r\n\r\nStill, rarely has criticism regarding Obama and the GLBT community come from the kind of person you would find standing in line at a spot like The Prop House, and there's a reason for that.\r\n\r\nDespite the catchiness of the slogan, gay is not the new black.\r\n\r\nBlack is still black.\r\n\r\nAnd if any group should know this, it's the gay community.\r\n\r\nBars such as The Prop House, or Bulldogs in Atlanta, Georgia, exist because a large number of gay blacks -- particularly those who date other blacks, and live in the black community -- do not feel a part of the larger gay movement. There are Gay Pride celebrations, and then there are Black Gay Prides.\r\n\r\nThere's a popular bar in the heart of the nation's capital that might as well rename itself Antebellum, because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor. Last year at the annual Human Rights Campaign national fundraiser in Washington, D.C. -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment.\r\n\r\nWhen Proposition 8 passed in California, white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent. At protest rallies that followed, some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants. Not to split hairs, but for most blacks, the n-word trumps the f-word.\r\n\r\nSo while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television, blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry. They see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets. And then there is the history.\r\n\r\nThe 40th anniversary of Stonewall dominated Gay Pride celebrations around the country, and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized, 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood-soaked years black people have been through in this country. There are stories some blacks lived through, stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told.\r\n\r\nWhile those who were at Stonewall talk about the fear of being arrested by police, 40 years ago, blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated. The 13th Amendment was signed in 1865, and it wasn't until 1948 that President Harry S Truman desegregated the military.

After all, dogs can't read. How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nKathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension", "1126": "Millions of people around the world have taken part in ceremonies marking the 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement.\r\n\r\nScouts renewed their promise to build a tolerant and peaceful society.\r\n\r\nDawn celebrations involving 28 million", "1127": "Felipe Calderon", "1128": "The airport terminal", "1129": "to use this information for a press conference", "1130": "Berlin's O2 World arena", "1131": "the city", "1132": "Friday that they had ever been terrorists and expressed gratitude toward U.S. President Barack Obama for working to free them.\r\n\r\nSalahidin Abdalahut and Kheleel Mamut were two of four Uyghurs released from Gitmo.

It's also about the same amount of radiation as other standard cardiac screenings, such as the nuclear stress test.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide range of exposures in the study depending on the medical center and the way the tests were performed. The median radiation dose ranged from 4.6 to 30 mSv. About 80 percent of the centers studied used techniques to reduce radiation, such as adjusting the CT scan to the patient's size (meaning smaller patients get less radiation) or precisely timing the radiation dose to a particular point in the heart rhythm (which shortens the duration of exposure).

I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating.

At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London.

I had hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course didn't make me lose a single pound) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism (a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain). My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must \"learn to embrace hunger\" or I would immediately gain weight. Believe me, no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the struggle I'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over. I felt completely defeated. I thought, \"I give up. I give up. Fat wins.\" All these years I'd had only myself to blame for lack of willpower.

The audience listened with rapt attention as Josh and several other Americans directly impacted by our broken immigration laws recounted their haunting tales.\r\n\r\nOur current immigration system is broken and greatly in need of reform. In order to create real, long-lasting reform, we must create a pathway to legal status for the millions of undocumented immigrants who have made lives for themselves and their families in the United States.

If you have money that you can afford to part with, get out there the first full week of the New Year. Everything from electronics to clothing to appliances to furniture will be a deal.\r\n\r\nBe careful if you shop from December 26 through January 4. The bargains are mostly fake ones during those 10 days because patterns are completely disrupted by gift cards. Most people are off from work between Christmas and New Years, have the time to shop and have the gift cards burning a hole in their wallets.\r\n\r\nStores are able to \"pretend\" to offer bargains in the immediate after-Christmas period and people feel like they \"have\" to spend right away with store credit from returns and that gift card dough. As a result, the discounts are relatively small. However, follow my way and your wallet will really smile on you.\r\n\r\nWait to do returns until after the 5th and those long return lines are gone. Retailers usually give 14 or so days after Christmas to do returns so you are still OK on the deadline and you don't have to wait in lines, which I avoid like the plague.\r\n\r\nThen think about it: You get the pick of all the merchandise that people returned that has been marked down and you get access to all the stuff that didn't sell that is on final clearance. But that's not all: I love January shopping because you have the stores virtually to yourself. My favorite time to go is Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night when you will find more employees than customers in the stores.\r\n\r\nI do have a special warning about all those gift cards.\r\n\r\nA lot of retailers that have been selling gift cards this season are not going to make it. Expect a wave of retailer bankruptcies in January, February and March. Over and over again bankruptcy court judges have wiped out the value of gift cards.

But the deals are usually fake. Many liquidators will sell the store's merchandise at a discount, but usually not as good as prices on a regular sale.\r\n\r\nThe real money is made by the liquidator in many cases by bringing in what I call \"fake\" goods. They are not literally fake, just things that were never sold in the store in the first place.

Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, most people, black and white, thought it would be, at best, an interesting sideshow.\r\n\r\nAfter Obama's victories in the early primaries, there came the controversial videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an Obama candidacy. But the senator moved quickly to reassure people that Wright's jaundiced view of America did not reflect his own.\r\n\r\nAmericans wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division. Obama understood that. And so did the voters. But African-Americans didn't believe it.\r\n\r\nSeventy-one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime, according to a national poll released in November by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible.\r\n\r\nObama did not just win the caucuses in Iowa  -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it. Other primary victories, once thought improbable, soon followed.\r\n\r\nThese included Georgia, and Virginia, the former seat of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nOn Election Day, Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did in 2004, though he did not get a majority of whites.\r\n\r\nUnlike other black presidential candidates before him, Obama did not run as \"the black candidate.\" He ran as a Democratic candidate, a U.S. senator from Illinois, and a progressive. And America, by larger margins than in previous recent elections, voted for the progressive Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois who happened to be biracial.\r\n\r\nFor too long, race has been the stain on the American fabric. As Secretary Condoleezza Rice reminded us, race has been our \"nation's birth defect.\" At times during the long primary and general election, race became a subtle distraction -- but the American people rejected it and it was never the primary issue.\r\n\r\nNor was it the primary issue for Americans who voted for Barack Obama. The vast majority of those who voted for and against Obama did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin.\r\n\r\nA lot of lessons were taught November 4. Obama's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for African-Americans: White America may not be as racist as African-Americans thought they were; a solution to our country's lingering racial problem may eventually be found; and the Rev. Martin Luther King's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach.\r\n\r\nObama's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the United States. \"A majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country's racial problems will eventually be found,\" said CNN polling director Keating Holland.\r\n\r\n\"In every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993, black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the American landscape. Even in the most recent polls taken last week, a majority of African-Americans said that a solution to the country's racial problems could be within reach; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end.\"\r\n\r\nYes, of course, racism still exists in America. But if a black man can become president of the United States of America, then aren't all Americans now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves?\r\n\r\nSo on this day, let us all rejoice and be glad. Let us celebrate this moment in American history and let us resolve to find common ground. Let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in America, as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations, dies the same death it did in the November ballot box.\r\n\r\nWhat our founders envisioned -- what President Lincoln and the Rev.

Clarence Holeman identified the victims as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe university terminated Zinkhan on Sunday, President Michael Adams told reporters on Monday.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas and owns a home in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was last seen driving a red, 2005 Jeep Liberty after the shootings Saturday.\r\r\n\r\r\nAuthorities do not believe Zinkhan is still on campus or in the city of Athens, University Police Chief Jimmy Williams said Monday. As a precaution, he added, security has been beefed up on campus, including officers on foot patrols carrying semiautomatic weapons.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe victims were all associated with the Town and Gown Players, a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The three people we lost (Saturday) were a part of the rich 50-year history of this theater and, more than that, were vital members of the Town and Gown family,\" the organization said Sunday on its Web site.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe site described Bruce as \"the binding force that held the Town and Gown community together.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Having worked with Town and Gown for over 20 years, at one time or another she served in every capacity at the theater, artistically and administratively, from leading lady to president of the board to chief cook and bottle washer.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHoleman said Saturday, \"It appeared (Zinkhan) and his wife (Bruce) were having problems.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMeanwhile, the university said that classes would be held Monday, as the school term enters its final week.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn a letter \"to the members of the University of Georgia community\" posted on the school's Web site, Adams said operations would continue uninterrupted.

Victims of Saturday's shooting will be honored at that service.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice said Zinkhan was not at the Town and Gown event originally but arrived and, according to Holeman of the Athens police, got into \"a disagreement\" with his wife. He left the scene, and police believe he went to his car, where the couple's children apparently were waiting, and returned with two handguns.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe shootings \"only took a few minutes,\" Holeman said. Police found eight shell casings.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter the shooting, Zinkhan left the scene with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived and left the children there.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe neighbor, Bob Covington, told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"He rang the doorbell, asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour,\" Covington said. \"I said sure, and he said there'd been some type of emergency, and he took off.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nZinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency, Covington said. He didn't question Zinkhan about the emergency, Covington said, adding that it wasn't unusual for someone in his family to watch the children.\r\r\n\r\r\nAn hour or so later, he said, police arrived and took the children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice searched Zinkhan's home on Saturday, but there was no indication of what evidence they might have gathered there.

The only British troops there will be a group of about a dozen helping to train Iraqi police as part of a NATO mission, the ministry said.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom's remaining contingent of 100 to 150 troops is leaving Iraq for neighboring Kuwait, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told CNN.

They are versions of our best selves: the doers in life, the fearless, those who go over the mountain and come back to tell us what's on the other side.\r\n\r\nWhile we may think the true adventurers are a species apart, we are all adventurers at heart -- yet sometimes the urge is stifled by modern life.\r\n\r\nThe lust for adventure is planted in childhood. How many of us sat enthralled under the blankets as our parents read us the adventures of the Famous Five, \"Treasure Island,\" \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" \"The Swiss Family Robinson,\" \"Tarzan\" and \"Peter Pan\"?\r\n\r\nChildren weaned on such stories may be forgiven for assuming adulthood is one long adventure that swings wildly between jungles, swamps, deserted islands and alpine heights.\r\n\r\nYet modern life is increasingly sedentary and safety-conscious. The desire for comfort and convenience ameliorates our contradictory urge to explore.\r\n\r\nA few have it thrust upon them: stranded in an inhospitable place, lost in a jungle or called up for combat -- and they find themselves dropped in an adventure that they may not have chosen; but for the main part, adventure comes to those who seek it.\r\n\r\nDr. James Thompson, a senior lecturer in psychology at University College London", "1854": "Australian media", "1855": "safety of the Haitians was still a consideration, but the military had taken steps to insure control over the distribution.\r\r\n\r\r\niReport: People continue looking for loved ones in Haiti\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are obviously concerned about the welfare of the people on the ground,\" he said, adding, \"I'm confident that our members on the ground have created a secure environment for us to conduct airdrop operations.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThis first flight carried a total of 9,600 bottles of water and 42,000 MRE packets. One MRE is usually considered one meal for a U.S. soldier in combat, but there is enough food in an MRE packet to make a small meal for two people.\r\r\n\r\r\nMost of the food in an MRE can be eaten straight from the plastic vacuum-packed pouch. But if water is added to a chemical heater, a hot meal results.\r\r\n\r\r\nEach pallet was rigged with a large parachute as well as special corrugated cardboard padding that would minimize damage to the water and food when the load hit the ground.\r\r\n\r\r\nOne of the supervisors on the rigging crew at the Army's Fort Bragg, which is adjacent to Pope Air Force Base, said they wanted to make sure as much of the aid, especially the water, survived the airdrop, but they predicted as many as 1-in-10 of the bottles would break on impact.

When a computer in the cockpit calculated that the plane was over the drop zone, a signal was given, the pilot pitched the plane upward and the huge straps and gate that held the cargo in place were released. Within seconds, gravity pulled all 40 pallets out of the plane and the parachutes automatically deployed.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn less than a minute the food and water was on the ground, ready to be unpacked and distributed.\r\r\n\r\r\nMaj.

When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre, severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat, and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed. It was flying the flag of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain, Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement  -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory.\r\n\r\nAlso on board was former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney.\r\n\r\nPenhaul said an Israeli patrol boat shined its spotlight on the Dignity, and then it and another patrol boat shadowed the Dignity for about a half hour before the collision.\r\n\r\nOne patrol boat \"very severely rammed\" the Dignity, Penhaul said.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning. Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities, the captain said.\r\n\r\nBut Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area.\r\n\r\nPalmor said there was no response to the radio message, and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat, leading to the collision.

Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza, which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies.\r\n\r\nTuesday's collision was so severe, Penhaul said, that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats.

Once fully trained, he will assist federal and local police officers as well as private corporations in nosing out deadly explosives at schools, airports and public events.\r\n\r\nHis detective skills can potentially save thousands of lives in an era where law enforcement agencies are aggressively fighting against drugs and terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\n\"Think about a scenario like the 1996 Olympic bombings,\" says Kaden's trainer Jeff Schettler, a cheery man who has coached hundreds of dogs to sniff out bombs, drugs, missing people and corpses since the mid-1990s.\r\n\r\nDemand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement. The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S. The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Watch three detection puppies in action \u00bb\r\n\r\nOfficial records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S. In more recent years, police departments realized a dog's nose was a valuable asset.\r\n\r\nDogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others. For each drop of odor detected by a dog, the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000 drops of odor, veterinarians say.  Can your pooch be a detection dog? \u00bb\r\n\r\nOther animals may have smelling skills that rival a dog's, such as pigs nosing for truffles in France or honey bees that can sniff out TNT particles, but veterinarians say dogs are the most controllable and sociable for their human handlers.\r\n\r\nPolice dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection, police officers say. Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats. They can find children who have mysteriously vanished overnight. Detection dogs can even weed out pest-infested apples and oranges accidentally left in suitcases at airports.\r\n\r\n\"They are a growing aspect of law enforcement,\" says Jim Watson, secretary at the North American Police Work Dog Association and a handler for decades.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, investigators were baffled during the international manhunt for George Zinkhan, a former University of Georgia professor accused of fatally shooting his wife and two other people.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks into the search, two cadaver dogs, a German shepherd named Circe and an Australian shepherd named Madison, arrived. Within 10 hours, the dogs picked up the scent of Zinkhan's remains in a shallow pit hidden in a thick forest. Once the dogs neared the suspect's body, they gave their handlers personalized signals. Circe barked excitedly. Madison lay down.\r\n\r\nTrainer Jeff Schettler explains Kaden is an unlikely candidate for police work. Basenjis, a breed that originated in central Africa, are usually used as hunting or show dogs. There are only two other trained police dog basenjis recorded by the North American Police Work Dog Association.\r\n\r\nMost trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs, preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record. Most law enforcement agencies rely on Belgian Malinoises and German shepherds for detection work because of their protective yet friendly personalities, but labs, bloodhounds and beagles also can be used.\r\n\r\n\"We're not trying to fix anything,\" Schettler says. \"We're trying to enhance it.\"\r\n\r\nSchettler points out some of Kaden's advantages: The dog's weight will peak at about 25 pounds", "2004": "60", "2005": "died", "2006": "Li Na", "2007": "the October 31 shooting of Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy.\n\nCassidy was shot in the head when he inadvertently walked into a robbery in progress at a Dunkin' Donuts.

I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet.\r\n\r\nI can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration.\r\n\r\nI can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth \u00bb\r\n\r\nSometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place.\r\n\r\nBut life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school.\r\n\r\nI was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media.\r\n\r\nAll my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally.\r\n\r\nMy ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian.\r\n\r\nUsually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be.\r\n\r\nIt's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom.\r\n\r\nI found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States and whom I contact through the Global Citizen Corps. I have realized how similar Palestinian youth are to youth all over the world. Catherine likes some of the food I like, and she loves swimming just like I do. There are also lovely differences between us: I tried to cook what she taught me once, and she is learning Arabic now.\r\n\r\nMaybe our lifestyle is different. I focus on my own development; I spend most of my time working to become a more qualified person with more knowledge and skills. I do not work hard because I am super girl or I aspire to be one but because I always want to be ready for the worst situation.

Then, on a trip to Europe, Barbara became fascinated with a buxom doll that Gerber said was based on a female German cartoon character, named Lilli, who used sex to get what she wanted.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My guess is she didn't know what it was when she bought it,\" because at that point, four years after the Lilli doll's release, it had landed in European toy stores, the author explained. Handler took the doll back to the states and insisted Mattel designers get to work.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Who would have thought,\" Gerber said. Barbie was thought up by a woman and modeled on a cartoon character \"who was essentially a prostitute.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThough the men at Mattel, a company that had never sold dolls before, were skeptical at best, Handler proved to be \"a corporate genius,\" Gerber said. In the three years after Barbie's release, Mattel's worth grew to $200 million, doubling the value earned in the first 20 years of business.\r\r\n\r\r\nHandler's daughter, now Barbara Segal, 67, is a bit dumbfounded by all the hype.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's been quite an interesting ride,\" she said from her Los Angeles, California, area home. \"I can't believe this doll's created all of this.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBarbie's collector line (not what's seen on Wal-Mart shelves) is designed for the grown-ups who still relish Barbie.

Billions of dollars have been spent transforming the landscape, erecting buildings which continue to break records of all dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe Burj Dubai -- at 818 meter the world's tallest skyscraper, the vast Palm Jumeirah -- built on land reclaimed from the sea, the Dubai Mall -- the largest shopping center in the world and the Mall of the Emirates; home to the world's biggest indoor ski slope form part of a very long list of completed construction projects.\r\n\r\n\"The whole place is kind of like a time-lapse film. You wake up in the morning and it's just a little bit different,\" Jim Krane, author of \"City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism\" told CNN.\r\n\r\nBut, according to Krane, some of these projects, like the Burj Dubai, suffer from a severe lack of practicality.\r\n\r\n\"Dubai doesn't really need to have to build tall asides from prestige purposes. If you look at it, it's a really bad idea. It uses as much electricity as an entire city. And every time the toilet is flushed they've got to pump water half a mile into the sky,\" he said\r\n\r\nThe telescopic shape is also presents problems of a more practical nature Krane thinks.\r\n\r\n\"The upper 30 or 40 floors are so tiny that they're useless, so they can't use them for anything else apart from storage. They've built a small, not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis prestige over practicality issue something of a recurring theme in Dubai's banner building projects.\r\n\r\nKrane, who lived and worked in Dubai from 2005 to 2007, also called into questions the attraction of the Palm Islands. The $12 billion Palm Jumeirah -- populated with valuable villas and hotels -- could have been a lot better he says.\r\n\r\n\"It's not been very well done.

The plaintiffs were identified only as Sarah Doe, Kimberly Doe and Raquel Doe \"to protect them from further harm,\" the ACLU said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe alleged attacks occurred while the plaintiffs were being transported from the T. Don Hutto Family Residential Center in Taylor, Texas, to the airport or bus station in nearby Austin, the ACLU said.\r\r\n\r\r\nIts release did not say where the class-action suit was filed Wednesday, but it said defendants include three ICE officials; Williamson County, Texas, where the Hutto facility is; the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), a private prison company that manages the Hutto facility; the former facility administrator for Hutto; and a guard at the facility.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe lawsuit alleges that ICE along with Williamson County and the Corrections Corporation of America were \"deliberately indifferent and willfully blind to the fact that (the guard named as a defendant) and other employees regularly violated the rule that detainees are not be transported without another escort officer of the same gender present,\" the ACLU said.\r\r\n\r\r\nICE did not comment specifically on the ACLU's announcement of the lawsuit", "2828": "Vehicles powered with hydrogen engines are different from the many vehicles across the nation that run with the help of hydrogen fuel cells -- which are the gold standard of green machines.\r\n\r\nThe use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is far less efficient than in the fuel cells.\r\n\r\nThe modified engines aboard the Ford E-450 shuttle buses are 6.8 liter V-10s. The airport's fleet also includes three gas-electric hybrid vehicles and 24 biodiesel buses. The facility also powers its maintenance equipment -- such as lawnmowers and tractors -- with biodiesel.\r\n\r\nBut like many experiments with alternative fuels, the price is very high and the long-term outcome is unknown. Proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken-and-egg dilemma over whether to build million-dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use.\r\n\r\nEnergy companies are reluctant to pour money into expensive fueling stations without a lot of hydrogen vehicles around, but consumers are not likely to buy a vehicle without adequate places to fill up.\r\n\r\n\"It is clear nothing is going to displace gasoline or diesel for 20, 30, maybe 40 years,\" said John Lapetz, who has been working on alternative fuels at Ford for more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nThe Orlando project has several goals: To get average consumers acquainted with hydrogen and to acquire data on the buses' performance in a setting where they are in use almost nonstop.\r\n\r\nLapetz said it's an effort to use a technology that customers take for granted (the internal combustion engine), while preparing for the day when drivers can complete the divorce from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nAt the Boggy Creek Hydrogen Fueling Station in Orlando, the hydrogen is produced on-site. \"We are doing a process called steam methane re-forming, which is natural gas to hydrogen,\" said Puneet Verma, manager of biofuels and hydrogen at Chevron Technology Ventures, one of the players involved in the project.\r\n\r\nDuring a careful fueling process, technicians check for leaks of the highly flammable hydrogen -- leaks both in the bus and the fuel pump.\r\n\r\nBecause a fossil fuel, methane, is used to make the hydrogen, the buses are about 12 percent cleaner than gasoline or diesel when their entire carbon footprint is measured.\r\n\r\n\"We view the hydrogen efforts as a technical success,\" said Verma. \"This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate actual production of hydrogen at the station. It's not necessarily an economic success yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ultimate goal is hydrogen fuel cell cars,\" Verma said. \"The hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive", "2829": "The News of the World", "2830": "it was probably the best movie I've ever seen", "2831": "more than 24", "2832": "Florida's Gulf Coast", "2833": "Nembe Creek \"trunk line\" were damaged", "2834": "Pakistani ties", "2835": "the Holocaust love story seemed incredible on its face.\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- I don't know whether to be sad or angry -- or both.

But by accepting those painful feelings, I had a watershed moment: I realized that I really wanted this marriage.\"\r\n\r\nRather than assuming divorce was inevitable, Joan started to see other possibilities. \"From that day to this, it's been a whole different experience,\" she says. \"My husband and I are still together, and in a way that I honestly didn't think was possible.\"\r\n\r\nFor Baraz, the best testimonials come from former skeptics; he admits that he himself wouldn't be the best case study. \"I've always been a relatively joyful, celebratory kind of person,\" he says. He found his spiritual path in Buddhism, but when his studies became very serious, so did he.\r\n\r\n\"Then I realized that the Buddha was called the Happy One, and he said, 'Go for the highest happiness.' That became the focus of my teaching.\" (Baraz points out that one needn't be a Buddhist, or of any particular faith, to reap the benefits of Awakening Joy. \"Ministers, rabbis, and secular experts have successfully used these basic principles", "2960": "al Qaeda", "2961": "9 a.m. at the Columbia Farms poultry processing plant", "2962": "the White House", "2963": "stabbed", "2964": "wider attention", "2965": "Wednesday", "2966": "nearly 100", "2967": "two", "2968": "more than 1,000 coalition and Afghan forces.

The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend.\r\n\r\n\"We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,\" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. \"It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paranormal Activity\" bills itself as \"the first-ever major film release demanded by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors.

That eastern African nation \"had a per-capita economy larger than South Korea's when I was born\" and now, he says, it has been \"badly outpaced.\"\r\n\r\nBut he said Kenya has restored stability after the violence that followed the disputed 2007 election.

Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions,\" he said. He said his administration will work \"to support those who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America will do.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the economy and opportunity, he said African nations need to stop focusing on one particular commodity, such as oil or cocoa, and \"promote multiple export industries, develop a skilled work force, and create space for small and medium-sized businesses that create jobs.\"\r\n\r\nHe cited \"our $3.5 billion food security initiative\" and said \"new methods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods to Africa\" is what is needed.

He said Africa has much potential to exploit its wind and solar power and geothermal energy and biofuels.\r\n\r\nAs for disease, Obama said strides are being made in dealing with HIV/AIDS and malaria, but \"too many still die from diseases that shouldn't kill them.\" He also indicated that there need to be ways to keep African doctors and nurses from going overseas and creating gaps in primary care.\r\n\r\n\"When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite, and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made.\"\r\n\r\nHe said his administration has committed $63 billion to fight disease, praising the \"strong efforts\" of his predecessor, George W.

In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\r\n\r\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\r\n\r\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\r\n\r\nIt's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime.

The male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison, al-Lahim said.\r\n\r\nThe man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him, according to al-Lahim. Citing phone records from the police investigation, al-Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client. He noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position.\r\n\r\nAl-Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day. It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law.\r\n\r\nAl-Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month, where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment, according to Human Rights Watch.\r\n\r\nHe told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al-Sheikh.\r\n\r\n\"Currently she doesn't have a lawyer, and I feel they're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights,\" he said. \"We will not accept this judgment and I'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place.\"\r\n\r\nHe said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month.\r\n\r\n\"The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia's Islamic law or sharia is not written and, therefore, subject to a wide array of interpretations.

Winds that complicated efforts to fight the spill died down Tuesday, making cleanup work easier, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's a gift of a little bit of time,\" she told reporters. \"But I'm not resting.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe spill threatens wildlife, beaches and livelihoods along the Gulf Coast. Already federal officials have banned fishing in the affected area until at least May 12, curtailing a commercial seafood industry that brings in about $2.4 billion to the region every year. The leading edge of the slick was reported to be lapping at the edge of Louisiana's Chandeleur Islands early Tuesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Let's make no mistake about what's at stake here. This is our very way of life,\" Jindal told reporters. \"This is our fishing communities, these are some of our coastal communities. We're talking about keeping this oil out of our fragile wetlands.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut as of mid-afternoon, no oil had been found washed up on the islands, said Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP, which owns the damaged well.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"To give you a sense of our ability to respond, we launched 22 vessels,\" Suttles told reporters at a news conference in Mobile, Alabama. Twelve of those vessels were shrimp boats whose skippers have volunteered to assist in the cleanup, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They've been in the area ever since trying to locate that oil and make sure it actually doesn't reach shore,\" Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe edge of the slick was reported to be about 20 miles off the Mississippi Coast, and Landry said it was about 30 miles off the shores of Alabama. Suttles said BP workers expected to close off one of the three leaking points Tuesday, but added, \"I don't believe that will change the total amount of oil that will be leaked.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nStephen Herbert, chef and owner of Abita Springs Cafe on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, said the potential impact was \"tremendous.\" But Herbert, who holds a degree in fish biology and lived in the marshes for 10 years before entering the restaurant business, expressed surprise that the story has become a national one.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I'm really astounded that the rest of the people in the United States really give a flip about this,\" he said. Louisiana's coastal marshlands have been shrinking at the rate of two football fields a day for a quarter-century, he said, \"and nobody gave a flip about that.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHerbert's 16-table restaurant, located 25 miles from New Orleans, specializes in Cajun food, and at least half of his orders are for meals that contain fish. In anticipation of rising prices, he ordered an extra gallon of shucked oysters and another case of shrimp, but that was all his refrigerators could store, the 56-year-old restaurateur said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe estimated 210,000-gallon-per-day flow of oil from the damaged well continued unabated Tuesday, 12 days after the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon sank off Louisiana. The break in the winds kept the slick from advancing much toward the coast, but Jindal said the weather is expected to turn unfavorably Thursday.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe first oil was not expected to reach the shores of the U.S. mainland for another three days, Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs owner of the well, BP is responsible for the cleanup and its costs. It blames Transocean, which it hired to drill the well, for the failure of a critical piece of equipment that was designed to shut off the well in case of emergency.\r\r\n\r\r\nAcross the Gulf Coast, emergency workers and volunteers helped string floating booms across inlets and beaches in an attempt to fend off any advancing oil. Chocolate-colored streaks of oily water could be seen off Dauphin Island, on the Alabama coast. And crew boats that normally supply oil wells were laying booms around Ship Island, off the shores of Mississippi and about 10 miles north of the spill's leading edge.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Capt. Louis Skrmetta, who runs excursions out to the Mississippi Sound barrier islands, said efforts to protect the islands and waterways were inadequate. He said Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour -- who called the spill \"a manageable problem\" Monday -- was doing less to combat the oncoming slick than his counterparts in Alabama and Louisiana.\r\r\n\r\r\nKNOE: Community rallies around rig families\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The governor's leaving it up to BP", "3340": "4 a.m.", "3341": "where they grinned and repeated their disbelief", "3342": "The neighbors", "3343": "mortgage foreclosures", "3344": "1992", "3345": "Shiite leaders died Wednesday after a lengthy battle with lung cancer, a senior official with his office told CNN.\r\n\r\nIraqi Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, seen in a 2007 photo, was an ally of both the U.S. and Iran.\r\n\r\nAbdul Aziz al-Hakim, who was born in 1950, died in Tehran, Iran, where he had been receiving treatment for more than two years, according to his adviser Haitham al-Husseini. Al-Hakim had recently suffered a medical setback, according to his party, which asked people to pray for him in a statement released on Sunday.\r\n\r\nHis body will be sent to Iraq and he will be buried in his hometown of Najaf, one of the holiest cities for Shiite Muslims, al-Husseini said.\r\n\r\nU.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill and the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, issued a joint statement expressing sadness over al-Hakim's death and describing him as \"a national leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,\" the statement said. \"We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.\"  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future \u00bb\r\n\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered his condolences, saying al-Hakim was \"like an old brother.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Maliki credited him for being a \"strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq.\"\r\n\r\n\"His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,\" al-Maliki said in the statement.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim ended his more than 20-year exile in Iran in 2003, when he returned to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his regime.\r\n\r\n\"It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,\" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. \"I was longing to see them. My goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them.\"\r\n\r\nIraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return.\r\n\r\nDuring his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHe took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south.\r\n\r\nSCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word \"revolution,\" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man.\r\n\r\nHis political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did.\r\n\r\nGovernment ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad.\r\n\r\nAnd when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence in Iraq, saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government, which raised concerns about what it called Iran's \"meddling.\" He cited the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries' shared border, historical and cultural relations, and emphasized the desire for strong ties.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim's death comes at a time of violent political turmoil in Iraq. The power of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq party he leaves behind is just as uncertain as the nation he so proudly wanted to serve.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007, and was first treated in the United States, then later in Iran.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Iraq later that year, he told CNN that he felt good. But it was around that time that it became apparent he was grooming his son, Ammar al-Hakim, to take over as head of ISCI.\r\n\r\nIt was once Iraq's most powerful Shiite political party", "3346": "itchy and red eyes and hyper-pigmentation", "3347": "Holocaust deniers", "3348": "1-0", "3349": "Donuts", "3350": "EEG data with standard psychometric tests", "3351": "Americans", "3352": "It sounds a little kooky when people first", "3353": "Washington's transit system", "3354": "biographical information", "3355": "the Kunduz hospital on Friday.\r\n\r\nCapt.

Their charred bodies were left dangling from a bridge over the Euphrates River in spring 2004.\r\n\r\nIn November of that year, U.S. and Iraqi forces attacked insurgents in Falluja, killing about 1,200 militants.

So without any structure for distribution or to provide security when things become available, then it seems to me that's a formula for contributing to chaos rather than -- rather than preventing it,\" Gates said.\r\r\n\r\r\nStrickland, commander of the airdrop mission, said safety of the Haitians was still a consideration, but the military had taken steps to insure control over the distribution.\r\r\n\r\r\niReport: People continue looking for loved ones in Haiti\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are obviously concerned about the welfare of the people on the ground,\" he said, adding, \"I'm confident that our members on the ground have created a secure environment for us to conduct airdrop operations.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThis first flight carried a total of 9,600 bottles of water and 42,000 MRE packets. One MRE is usually considered one meal for a U.S. soldier in combat, but there is enough food in an MRE packet to make a small meal for two people.\r\r\n\r\r\nMost of the food in an MRE can be eaten straight from the plastic vacuum-packed pouch. But if water is added to a chemical heater, a hot meal results.\r\r\n\r\r\nEach pallet was rigged with a large parachute as well as special corrugated cardboard padding that would minimize damage to the water and food when the load hit the ground.\r\r\n\r\r\nOne of the supervisors on the rigging crew at the Army's Fort Bragg, which is adjacent to Pope Air Force Base, said they wanted to make sure as much of the aid, especially the water, survived the airdrop, but they predicted as many as 1-in-10 of the bottles would break on impact. The MREs are much less susceptible to damage during airdrops.

When a computer in the cockpit calculated that the plane was over the drop zone, a signal was given, the pilot pitched the plane upward and the huge straps and gate that held the cargo in place were released. Within seconds, gravity pulled all 40 pallets out of the plane and the parachutes automatically deployed.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn less than a minute the food and water was on the ground, ready to be unpacked and distributed.\r\r\n\r\r\nMaj.

The election that occurred Sunday should be a second.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war. Sunday's election could be seen as a referendum on the euro-elites who so strongly opposed that war.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe conservatives who governed Spain in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the United States after the 9/11 attacks. In 2003-2004, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as George Bush's most prominent ally on the European continent. Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel.\r\r\n\r\r\nYet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print.

The same is true at Friendfield Plantation outside Georgetown, South Carolina.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis is a former slave house on Friendfield Plantation, where Michelle Obama's family has roots.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's not exactly \"Gone With the Wind,\" but what makes this overgrown 3,300 acres of marsh and pine trees stand out is this: The family of first lady Michelle Obama believes her great-great grandfather was held as a slave here and labored in the mosquito-infested rice fields.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt makes Friendfield Plantation a symbol of something more than servitude. It's the symbol of something that's never happened before, one important segment of an American family's journey from the humiliation of slavery to the very top of the nation's ruling class.\r\r\n\r\r\nCNN recently was the first television network allowed to visit the plantation and shoot video. It's not a museum. It's just private land, still with shadows of its past.\r\r\n\r\r\nFriendfield's most distinctive historical feature, perhaps, is the dirt road known as Slave Street.

It would have been hot and humid in summer, and most certainly cold in winter, although the shacks had fireplaces.\r\r\n\r\r\nThey would have been crowded: probably one or two families living in a space smaller than a modern-day garage.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe White House is some 472 miles from Georgetown, South Carolina.

When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre, severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat, and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed. It was flying the flag of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain, Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement  -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory.\r\n\r\nAlso on board was former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney.\r\n\r\nPenhaul said an Israeli patrol boat shined its spotlight on the Dignity, and then it and another patrol boat shadowed the Dignity for about a half hour before the collision.\r\n\r\nOne patrol boat \"very severely rammed\" the Dignity, Penhaul said.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning. Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities, the captain said.\r\n\r\nBut Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area.\r\n\r\nPalmor said there was no response to the radio message, and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat, leading to the collision.  Watch Penhaul describe the boat damage \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally, Penhaul said, but Palmor called those allegations \"absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody,\" Palmor said.\r\n\r\n\"I would call it ramming. Let's just call it as it is,\" McKinney said after the boat docked in Lebanon. \"Our boat was rammed three times, twice in the front and one on the side.  Watch Cynthia McKinney discuss the collision \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in international waters about 90 miles off Gaza. Israel controls the waters off Gaza's coast and routinely blocks ships from coming into the Palestinian territory as part of an ongoing blockade that also applies to the Israel-Gaza border. Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza, which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies.\r\n\r\nTuesday's collision was so severe, Penhaul said, that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats. The Dignity began taking on water, but the crew managed to pump it out of the hull long enough for the boat to reach shore.\r\n\r\n\"It could have ended with people drowning if they hit us more square on,\" Dignity's captain, Denis Healey, said. \"It could have gone down in minutes.\"\r\n\r\nPalmor said the vessel refused assistance after the incident.\r\n\r\nThe boat was carrying boxes of relief supplies, volunteers and journalists to Gaza, the Palestinian territory that has been subject to an intense Israeli bombing campaign since Saturday.\r\n\r\nIsrael Tuesday lambasted McKinney -- the Green Party's 2008 candidate for the U.S. presidency and a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia -- for taking part in the maritime mission.\r\n\r\nIn a written statement, the Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast, based in Atlanta, Georgia, said McKinney \"has taken it upon herself to commit an act of provocation,\" endangering herself and the crew.\r\n\r\n\"We regret that during this time of crisis, while Israel is battling with the terrorist organization of Hamas and defending its citizens, that we are forced to deal with Ms. McKinney's irresponsible behavior,\" the statement read.\r\n\r\nThe trip was the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement's sixth in as many months.\r\n\r\nIsrael launched airstrikes against Gaza on Saturday in what Defense Minister Ehud Barak called an \"all-out war\" against the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007.

One MRE is usually considered one meal for a U.S. soldier in combat, but there is enough food in an MRE packet to make a small meal for two people.\r\r\n\r\r\nMost of the food in an MRE can be eaten straight from the plastic vacuum-packed pouch. But if water is added to a chemical heater, a hot meal results.\r\r\n\r\r\nEach pallet was rigged with a large parachute as well as special corrugated cardboard padding that would minimize damage to the water and food when the load hit the ground.\r\r\n\r\r\nOne of the supervisors on the rigging crew at the Army's Fort Bragg, which is adjacent to Pope Air Force Base, said they wanted to make sure as much of the aid, especially the water, survived the airdrop, but they predicted as many as 1-in-10 of the bottles would break on impact.

See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research \u00bb\r\n\r\nResearchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body. Stem cells have this ability for a short time. A few days before the embryo would implant in the uterus, it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus.  Watch a doctor explain why embryotic stem cells are so important \u00bb\r\n\r\nWhen the embryo is 4 or 5 days old, scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish. With the removal of these stem cells -- of which there may be about 30 -- the embryo is destroyed.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one of the 60 stem cell lines authorized for research under the Bush policy have proven useful to researchers.

If you're alive, you need help.\"\r\n\r\nThere are also guided meditations, including instructions on how to be mindful --being present for whatever you're doing and, as Baraz says, \"simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different.\"\r\n\r\nFor Joan, that turned out to be a bigger challenge than singing -- especially when her husband suggested that they begin the separation process.\r\n\r\n\"Awakening Joy isn't about being a happy little do bee,\" she says. \"You're taught that when feelings arise, no matter what they are, you stay with them. When my husband said we should contact a mediator, I cried years of tears. But by accepting those painful feelings, I had a watershed moment: I realized that I really wanted this marriage.\"\r\n\r\nRather than assuming divorce was inevitable, Joan started to see other possibilities. \"From that day to this, it's been a whole different experience,\" she says. \"My husband and I are still together, and in a way that I honestly didn't think was possible.\"\r\n\r\nFor Baraz, the best testimonials come from former skeptics; he admits that he himself wouldn't be the best case study. \"I've always been a relatively joyful, celebratory kind of person,\" he says. He found his spiritual path in Buddhism, but when his studies became very serious, so did he.\r\n\r\n\"Then I realized that the Buddha was called the Happy One, and he said, 'Go for the highest happiness.' That became the focus of my teaching.\" (Baraz points out that one needn't be a Buddhist, or of any particular faith, to reap the benefits of Awakening Joy. \"Ministers, rabbis, and secular experts have successfully used these basic principles,\" he says.)\r\n\r\nThe idea for the course began eight years ago, when Baraz's wife, Jane, gave him a book called \"How We Choose to Be Happy,\" by Rick Foster and Greg Hicks. \"The instructions made a lot of sense, but they didn't have a spiritual dimension,\" Baraz says. \"So I added that and presented it as a series of talks with my weekly meditation group for about three months to see what would happen.\" The results: \"We got happier and happier!\"\r\n\r\nBaraz then turned Awakening Joy into a six-month class and found that participants maintained a positive attitude even after it ended (as long as they practiced the exercises; as with diets or working out, continuity is essential).\r\n\r\nWord of mouth about the course that could make people happier began to spread: The first round of Awakening Joy meetings consisted of about 40 members. The next numbered 100; the next, 200, and then 500. It went international when its members began e-mailing their monthly homework assignments from the lectures to friends. Baraz was thrilled to receive messages from strangers in Europe, Africa, and New Zealand. \"It works!\" they wrote.

I felt guilty about not being able to work, and I thought people were judging me.\" Though a specialist was able to alleviate some of her physical discomfort, Gretchen fell into a deep depression.\r\n\r\nShe heard about Awakening Joy after taking Baraz's meditation classes at Spirit Rock. \"The first thing I was hit by was the instruction to notice what it feels like when you're happy,\" she says. \"I loved the walks I took to help my back, but before, I just plodded down the street, not noticing anything.

He was subdued by passengers and crew.\r\r\n\r\r\nNo air marshals were on the flight, generating additional criticism of the service.\r\r\n\r\r\nDespite efforts by Obama and assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that FAMS will become more effective, one air marshal told CNN, \"Nothing's particularly changed for me since Christmas Day, or (for) a big percentage of people that I work with. Everything is pretty much the same.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIn January, Napolitano testified before a Senate committee, where she vowed, \"We will strengthen the capacity of aviation law enforcement, including the Federal Air Marshal Service.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nInternational flights are considered to have the highest risk.\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, air marshals from a half dozen FAMS field offices said the agency continues to assign marshals to short, regional routes on small jets. The marshals told CNN that lots of short-haul flights make the agency look more productive on paper.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe marshals said if someone dares criticize a manager, he or she can be banished to what they call \"Team America,\" referring to the regional trips.\r\r\n\r\r\nManagers and favored employees receive the perk of traveling international routes, they said.\r\r\n\r\r\nRepeatedly, air marshals reported that the decision on who flies on what flights are driven by extra pay for managers, and office politics -- not security.\r\r\n\r\r\nDespite repeated requests, FAMS and its parent agency, the Transportation Security Administration, declined to give CNN an interview.\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, TSA spokesman Nelson Minerly provided a statement, saying, \"The Transportation Security Administration's Federal Air Marshals are strategically deployed aboard U.S. flagged air carriers to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The Federal Air Marshal Service is currently training and deploying fellow federal law enforcement officers to support the administration's enhancement in aviation security. Federal Air Marshals and these additional highly trained officers are being deployed aboard an increasing number of flights worldwide to keep air travel safe,\" Minerly wrote.\r\r\n\r\r\nRep. John Duncan, R-Tennessee, is one of FAMS' harshest critics.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's just a total waste of money,\" he told CNN in a recent interview.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I know that any time you create a federal bureaucracy, it just grows and grows, and the appropriation just goes up and up, but ... look at the record.

Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, doesn't want FAMS eliminated, she wants it revamped.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"If we've got those kinds of problems, we need to get a ready broom and sweep,\" she said. \"The only way we are going to ensure the security and safety of the American people is that we have staff par excellence, and I know they are out there.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAlthough the actual number of air marshals is classified, it has been widely reported that the number of air marshals covering 28,000 flights per day is fewer than 4,000. Even with a generous calculation, the marshals only cover 5 percent of flights, according to CNN assessments.\r\r\n\r\r\nCNN has been studying FAMS for three years, and during that time, air marshals have accused managers of using creative accounting to pad the numbers given to Congress.\r\r\n\r\r\nThey describe an agency in chaos that, in some cases, promotes discrimination against minorities.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We don't have managers who provide training or provide leadership", "4226": "an opposition party showed police", "4227": "Coatesville", "4228": "Hickstead", "4229": "Spain", "4230": "U.S. operations are classified", "4231": "office.\r\n\r\nTwo other residents were taken to area hospitals", "4232": "at least Wednesday", "4233": "injured his shoulder", "4234": "a broomstick and hockey stick", "4235": "attention on several previous cases", "4236": "said", "4237": "Ronald and Misty Cummings during the search for Haleigh", "4238": "political violence", "4239": "The $100 million lawsuit", "4240": "first \"Batman\" movie", "4241": "more than 98 percent", "4242": "writers, musicians, and filmmakers over the past decade.\r\n\r\n\"Elephant,\" musician Marilyn Manson, and the bestseller \"Nineteen Minutes\" entered the spotlight post-Columbine.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't the first school shooting, but it became the extreme case,\" said Robert Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. \"The word 'Columbine' became a word that represented something much, much larger than that particular high school.\"\r\n\r\nColumbine, in some ways, represents the broad insecurity triggered by extreme acts of violence.\r\n\r\nLittleton, Colorado, is as picturesque as the set of a family film.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks in part to the 24-hour news cycle, the world witnessed scenes that appeared to be out of a movie: bloodied victims escaping through windows and frightened teens scurrying to safety as law enforcement descended.\r\n\r\nFilm critic Desson Thomson said films such as Gus Van Sant's \"Elephant\" do not have to reach far into the American psyche to tell a tale of horror in a post-Columbine world.\r\n\r\n\"Columbine is now a little like the way 9/11 is engrained in our cultural perspective, so that something like 'Elephant' doesn't even have to directly allude to it,\" he said. \"Because we were so immersed in Columbine...the filmmakers know that the audience has that reference point, so it doesn't take much to even poke at that for all of that dimension to come swimming through our consciousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elephant,\" which won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003, dramatized a normal day at a high school that is about to become the scene of a planned mass slaughter by a pair of friends.\r\n\r\nTelevision shows such as \"Law & Order\" and \"Cold Case\" also delved into the lives of fictitious teens on murderous rampages.\r\n\r\nBut music is the one medium that seemed almost primed for an interpretation of the day's events.\r\n\r\nShock rocker Marilyn Manson", "4243": "the Democratic health care reform bill the previous month.\r\r\n\r\r\nCalling himself an \"investigative journalist,\" O'Keefe claimed he was trying to test the credibility of a claim by Landrieu that her office had been unable to field calls from constituents opposed to her stance on the Senate health care bill because her phone lines had been \"jammed for weeks.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBasel and Flanagan told a staffer in Landrieu's office that they were telephone repairmen and were granted access to the reception desk's phone system.

Mays was the \"bearded, lovable rogue,\" said Sullivan. Mays built a trademark with his shouting style and blue shirt and khaki pants.\r\r\n\r\r\nSullivan was the mastermind behind those ads, acting as director and producer after competing against Mays for years in the cutthroat world of TV pitchmen.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo his credit, Sullivan -- like Mays -- has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of products -- many of them you've likely seen on TV.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut before Sullivan moved countless Stick Up Bulbs, Smart Choppers, One Sweeps and Swivel Sweepers -- his first TV sales pitch almost happened by mistake.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 1993, Sullivan stopped by the cable shopping channel HSN to sell a product called the SmartMop. At first, while chatting informally with a show host about the mops, Sullivan was unaware that the robotic cameras were trained on him.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Are we on?\" he asked, already realizing the answer to his question.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I just sort of froze for half a second, and I thought sh--, I just gotta pitch.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nNine minutes later, the phone lines exploded. After 22 minutes, Sullivan had sold 5,000 SmartMops. Not bad for his first time at bat.\r\r\n\r\r\nEventually, Mays also joined HSN and the two men \"lit up that network\" for the next six years, said Sullivan.\r\r\n\r\r\nDifferent styles\r\r\n\r\r\nThe two pitchmen wield very different styles. As Sullivan describes it, Mays' secret weapon was himself and his bearded pitchman character to grab viewers' attention.\r\r\n\r\r\nSullivan, on the other hand, mesmerizes viewers with his southwestern English accent. He describes his style as honing in on viewers and focusing on the benefits of the product.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore earning U.S. citizenship, a younger Sullivan cut his teeth in the English street markets of London, drawn to the fast-talking Artful Dodgers who were as much entertainers as they were hucksters and pitchers. \"I was always amazed.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe London pitchmen -- following a centuries-old tradition in places like Petticoat Lane, Portobello Road and Blackbushe Market -- knew they'd won over a crowd when they'd see a husband nudge a wife acknowledging they'd been entertained.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They'd say, 'You know, we watched this guy pitch his heart out and even though we really don't need what he's selling, he made us laugh.' They'd give you a 10-pound tip and take whatever it was we were selling. And I really enjoyed that part of the business.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nSullivan says street pitching has become a virtual lost art now because of eBay and the Internet.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It was just poetic, these pitches,\" recalled Sullivan, quoting some of the riffs that still echo across the years. 'Ladies and gentlemen, here's where we sort the needy from the greedy, the spiers from the buyers, the ones that trust me from the ones that don't.' It was just this poetry -- if you will. That's where poetry meets sales.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the world of TV pitches, poetry meets sales with phrases like, \"For zest, it's the best!\" and \"That's cash in the trash!\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAs Sullivan says, the best pitchers demonstrate their products -- and the bigger the demonstration, the better. He's been set on fire and shared a kitchen with a grizzly bear. \"Some pretty crazy stuff.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThis month Sullivan spent a day being dunked in the Florida intercoastal waterway. Sullivan went parasailing in a suit wrapped in a product called Mighty Thirsty, plunging into the water to demonstrate its absorbency. \"It was a strange moment, but only Billy could have got me there.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBecause of his street market background -- or perhaps in spite of it -- Sullivan admits that some think his sales approach is more sophisticated than Mays' boisterous, bellowing banter.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think we're both relentless.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMays died shortly after he and Sullivan wrapped the first season of Discovery Channel's reality based TV series PitchMen.\r\r\n\r\r\nAccording to a Hillsborough County, Florida, autopsy report issued in August, Mays died from a heart attack -- with cocaine listed as a contributing factor.\r\r\n\r\r\nChoosing to move forward after Mays' death, Sullivan and Discovery are producing a second season of PitchMen without casting a replacement for Mays. The refreshed program will focus more on inventors who pitch their products to be accepted for a Sullivan TV ad campaign.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think Billy would have slapped me on the side of the head if I didn't continue with it,\" said Sullivan.\r\r\n\r\r\n'Life's a pitch and then you buy it'\r\r\n\r\r\nMays lives on in thousands of YouTube videos, where he's often heard saying, \"Life's a pitch and then you buy it.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEveryone is always selling or buying something, whether they realize it or not, said Sullivan.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"When your child's applying for college -- it's no different from pitching. You're pitching yourself, your services, your family. You're selling your house, you're buying a house. Everyone is involved in the buying or selling process. Even if you're buying -- you're being sold.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHow does Sullivan make the sale? \"I think you have to be passionate. You have to be sincere. You have to really believe in what you sell. You have to do it with a smile. I often think that if you can make someone laugh while you're selling -- and disarm them with a little bit of humor -- it goes such a long way.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut that's not all, as the pitchmen often say. There's more to this story.\r\r\n\r\r\nLately, Mays' 23-year-old son, Billy Mays III, has been working at Sullivan's production company.\r\r\n\r\r\nRight now, the 23-year-old musician isn't interested in following his father's path as a pitchman. \"He has his father's soul, but he's his own man in his own way,\" said Sullivan.\r\r\n\r\r\nEven as Sullivan hawks Mays' former brands", "4261": "the online system", "4262": "the bowels", "4263": "the November 28, 2010", "4264": "25 kilometers", "4265": "the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris, said LeRoy Cain, the shuttle program's deputy manager.\r\n\r\nLast week, a piece of debris forced the space station's current crew -- astronauts Mike Fincke and Sandy Magnus, and cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov -- to take shelter in its escape capsule, a rare close call for the orbiting platform, NASA said.\r\n\r\nThat object, a chunk of metal from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission, was about 5 inches across, and moving at nearly 20,000 mph.

In the interim, he said, the Defense Department will start enforcing the policy \"in a fairer manner.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGates said Thursday that, moving ahead:\r\r\n\r\r\n\u2022 The Pentagon will raise the level of the officer authorized to start a fact-finding inquiry or separation proceeding as a result of alleged homosexual conduct to a general or flag officer in the accused service member's chain of command.\r\r\n\r\r\n\u2022 Only a lieutenant colonel, Navy commander or higher ranking officer will be authorized to conduct a fact-finding inquiry.\r\r\n\r\r\n\u2022 Only a general or flag officer in an accused service member's chain of command will be authorized to initiate expulsion proceedings.\r\r\n\r\r\n\u2022 The Pentagon will revise what constitutes credible information to begin an inquiry or separation proceeding. For example, Gates, said, the Defense Department will specify that information given by third parties should be given under oath.

But the information filed Wednesday alleges that Barrett also taped Andrews through an altered peephole in a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio, in February 2008. Barrett stayed in the hotel room next door to Andrews, the information said.\r\n\r\nHe is charged with interstate stalking, which carries a potential sentence of five years in prison, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California.\r\n\r\nBarrett was arrested in Illinois, but will make an initial appearance in federal court in Los Angeles on Friday, Mrozek said. He is scheduled to be arraigned on November 23 and will be asked to enter a plea.\r\n\r\nAn Illinois judge last month released Barrett on bail.\r\n\r\nBarrett waived his right to be indicted by a grand jury, Mrozek said, and authorities on Wednesday filed a criminal information against him in place of an indictment.\r\n\r\nInvestigators found that Barrett reserved a room at a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, hotel where Andrews was staying in July 2008, but did not check in, according to prosecutors and the initial criminal complaint against him last month.\r\n\r\nThe complaint accused him of making seven videos from the surreptitious tapes.\r\n\r\nIn Nashville, the door peephole into Andrews' room was altered with a hacksaw, and the peephole to her room in Milwaukee was altered in a similar way, the criminal complaint said. Authorities believe the videos were taken with a cell phone camera.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the complaint said that Barrett \"traveled from Illinois to Victim Andrews' home state\" in August 2008, but did not specify which state.\r\n\r\nBarrett allegedly attempted to sell the videos to celebrity gossip site TMZ in January 2009. TMZ did not purchase the images, but employees of the Web site assisted in the investigation by providing information to Andrews' attorneys, authorities said.

I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats will add pensively to the words: \"Not Done\" from the \"SNL\" skit, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans would add assertively : \"Not ever!\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \"Camelot II\"; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care.\r\n\r\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise.

On the other end of the spectrum, 37 percent of MySpace members earn less than $50,000 annually, compared with about 28 percent of Facebook users.\r\n\r\nMySpace users tend to be \"in middle-class, blue-collar neighborhoods,\" said Mike Mancini, vice president of data product management for Nielsen, which used an online panel of more than 200,000 social media users in the United States in August. \"They're on their way up, or perhaps not college educated.\"\r\n\r\nBy contrast, Mancini said, \"Facebook [use] goes off the charts in the upscale suburbs,\" driven by a demographic that for Nielsen is represented by white or Asian married couples between the ages of 45-64 with kids and high levels of education.\r\n\r\nEven more affluent are users of Twitter, the microblogging site, and LinkedIn, a networking site geared to white-collar professionals. Almost 38 percent of LinkedIn users earn more than $100,000 a year.\r\n\r\nNielsen also found a strong overlap between those who use Facebook and those who use LinkedIn, Mancini said.\r\n\r\nNielsen isn't the first to find this trend. Ethnographer danah boyd, who does not capitalize her name, said she watched the class divide emerge while conducting research of American teens' use of social networks in 2006.\r\n\r\nWhen she began, she noticed the high school students all used MySpace, but by the end of the school year, they were switching to Facebook.\r\n\r\nWhen boyd asked why, the students replied with reasons similar to Owens: \"the features were better; MySpace is dangerous and Facebook is safe; my friends are here,\" boyd recalled.\r\n\r\nAnd then, boyd said, \"a young woman, living in a small historical town in Massachussetts said to me, 'I don't mean to be a racist or anything, but MySpace is like, ghetto.'\" For boyd, that's when it clicked.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a matter of choice between Facebook and MySpace, it was a movement to Facebook from MySpace,\" she said, a movement that largely included the educated and the upper-class.\r\n\r\nSo why do our online worlds, unencumbered by what separates us in daily life, reflect humans' tendency to stick with what -- and who -- they know?\r\n\r\nA lot of it has to do with the disparate beginnings of MySpace and Facebook, said Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief of Mashable, a blog about social media. Facebook originated at Harvard University and was limited at first to students at approved colleges before opening itself to the public in September 2006.\r\n\r\nMySpace, on the other hand, had a \"come one, come all\" policy and made a mad dash towards monetization, Ostrow said. \"They used a lot of banner ads without regard to the quality, and it really diminished the value [of the site] for the more tech-savvy demographic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the Internet can build bridges between people on opposite sides of the globe, we still tend to connect with the same people through online social networks who we connect with offline, said technology writer and blogger Sarah Perez.\r\n\r\n\"It's effectively a mirror to our real world,\" she told CNN. \"Social networks are the online version of what kids do after school.\"\r\n\r\nThese social-networking divides are worrisome to boyd, who wrote \"Taken Out of Context: American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics.\" Instead of allowing us to cross the boundaries that exist in our everyday lives, these online class differences threaten to carry those boundaries into the future.\r\n\r\n\"The social-network infrastructure is going to be a part of everything going forward, just like [Web] search is,\" boyd said. \"The Internet is not this great equalizer that rids us of the problems of the physical world -- the Internet mirrors and magnifies them. The divisions that we have in everyday life are going to manifest themselves online.\"\r\n\r\nJason Kaufman, a research science fellow with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, examined the Facebook profiles of a group of college students over four years and found that even within Facebook, there's evidence of self-segregation.\r\n\r\nMultiracial students tended to have more Facebook friends than students of other backgrounds and were often the sole connection between white and black circles, Kaufman said.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Kaufman feels that social networks may one day help us overcome our instinct to associate with those who share our income level, education, or racial background.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's fair to say that the Web has great potential to at least mitigate everyday tendencies towards self-segregation and social exclusion,\" Kaufman said. \"In some ways, [Facebook] levels the playing field of friendship stratification. In the real world, you have very close friends and then there are those you just say \"Hi\" to when you pass them on the street.\r\n\r\n\"The playing field is a lot more level in that you can find yourself having a wall-to-wall exchange with just an acquaintance. If you pick up the unlikely friend, not of your race or income bracket, the network may [help you] establish a more active friendship than if you met them in real life.\"\r\n\r\nBut MySpace's users still find something appealing about MySpace that they don't about Facebook, and it may have nothing to do with class or race, blogger Perez said.\r\n\r\n\"It's not just the demographics that have people picking one over the other,\" Perez said. \"It also comes down to what activities you like. If you like music, you'll still be on MySpace. If you're more into applications, then you might go to Facebook because you're addicted to Mafia Wars or whatever.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, boyd isn't as concerned about the reasons behind these divisions online as she is about the consequences of people only networking within their chosen social-media groups.\r\n\r\n\"Friendships and family relationships are socially divided; people self-segregate to deal with racism sometimes,\" she said. \"Okay, fine: We've made a decision to self-segregate, but what happens when politicians go on Facebook and think they're reaching the whole public? What happens when colleges only go on Facebook to promote?\"\r\n\r\nWhen and if that does happen, Mashable's Ostrow said, we'll know perhaps we've given social networks more credit than they're worth. \"When it comes to information, I don't think social networks are the best source for that. The Internet is so open,\" said Ostrow, who believes users would go beyond their networks to search out information online.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to branch out of your social network box, your best option may be Twitter.

Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where.\r\n\r\nOfficials at Forest Lawn won't disclose where Jackson's body is being buried. If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months.\r\n\r\nThere has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch.\r\n\r\nIf a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite.\r\n\r\n\"If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,\" said Steve Goldstein, author of L.A.'s Gravesite Companion: Where the VIP's RIP. \"He'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over Marilyn.\"\r\n\r\nFame follows celebrities in life and in death.\r\n\r\n\"There's always a fascination with celebrities, but it's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses,\" says Jim Tipton, founder of findagrave.com, a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens. \"But once they are interred into the ground, anyone who wants to go can go.\"\r\n\r\nTipton's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago, when he saw mobster Al Capone's grave in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi.\r\n\r\nI trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.\r\n\r\nBy mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London.

Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: \"He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ...

He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \"chitlin circuit\" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \"the last big stars to come off my assembly line,\" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site.\r\n\r\nThe group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a collaboration,\" Gamble said. \"They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians.\"\r\n\r\nHuff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a \"fantastic meal\" cooked by Katherine Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing but respect for the father,\" added Gamble. \"He's a great man. He made something out of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nEven during that era, however, Michael was standing out. Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded.

That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe game's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times. Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles. Melee was improved (I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory.\r\r\n\r\r\nStealth has become a more effective tool in some missions. There was one mission, however, where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill. It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance.\r\r\n\r\r\nTargeting specific areas on enemies also didn't seem to matter. There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down.

The Chinese child prodigy started playing piano at the age of 3, won his first competition aged 5, and today age 27, he is on Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.\r\n\r\nOn this month's Revealed, we follow the piano prodigy on an adventure out of his classical zone, and into the jazz world to meet his hero, American legend Herbie Hancock. Hancock narrates us through this journey, following Lang Lang back to China for a bittersweet trip down memory lane, and then onto Montreux in Switzerland for his first foray into the jazz world.\r\n\r\nToday Lang Lang is so much in demand that he is constantly on the move, joking to CNN, \"I am a professional traveler.\" Revealed joins Lang Lang on board his private jet on a trip to China, where his megastardom has reached levels which make public outings rather problematic; Lang Lang is mobbed as soon as he sets foot on the street. We talk to his parents about the practice regime they implemented from the age of 4, and the ruthless work ethic that they believe has brought him success.\r\n\r\nLang Lang has made it his mission to share classical music around the world, with an emphasis on training children through outreach programs. Following his performance at the opening of Beijing's 2008 Olympic Games, he became a symbol of the youth and future of China. This status has inspired over 35 million Chinese children to learn to play classical piano - a phenomenon popularly referred to as \"the Lang Lang effect.\" Revealed documents the days leading up to Lang Lang's next major Chinese performance. He has been selected by the government to perform in celebrations of the 60-year Anniversary of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, a fitting performance for the prodigy who is seen to embody modern China.\r\n\r\nThe frenzy surrounding Lang Lang in China inspired iconic piano maker Steinway to create their first piano branded in someone's name. On a visit to the Steinway shop along the way, Lang Lang meets two aspiring young pianists, and Revealed captures an impromptu masterclass with the two young boys.\r\n\r\nLang Lang is not however everyone's cup of tea. Famously \"loved by some, reviled by others,\" there are those who find his flashy image and demonstrative performing styles at odds with the world of classical music. But Lang Lang is not concerned about that. His mission is to spread a love of music and popularize classical works.\r\n\r\nRevealed follows him to the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, where he teams up with his hero, Jazz legend Hancock. The feeling of admiration is entirely mutual, and for Hancock who has not played classical repertoire in many years, he is feeling out of his depth. \"Lang Lang is totally amazing, I'm pretty terrified to be up on stage playing alongside him. I've never practiced so much in my life!\" Backstage another Jazz legend Quincy Jones has popped by for the concert, remarking, \"Lang Lang has taken the world by storm.

We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places.\r\n\r\nDefterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment.\r\n\r\nSheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us.

The procedure has allowed the company to collect more than 1,000 barrels (42,000 gallons) of oil a day that would otherwise spill into the Gulf, said Doug Suttles, the company's chief operating officer. That, combined with the use of chemical dispersants to break up the spill, has reduced the amount of oil reaching the surface, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This [is] probably the smallest amount of oil I've seen on the surface since the effort began,\" Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe well had been spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day into the Gulf since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Eleven workers are presumed dead after the sinking, and the cause has not been determined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSome of the oil has washed ashore on the Louisiana coast, and tar balls related to the spill have turned up as far east as Dauphin Island, Alabama.\r\r\n\r\r\nSome estimates put the amount of oil gushing from the well far higher than the 5,000-barrel-per-day estimate made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a few days after the spill began. Samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface.\r\r\n\r\r\nSamantha Joye, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia, told CNN's \"American Morning\" that the size of the suspected plumes is hard to determine.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Nothing like it has really ever been seen in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico before,\" she said. \"It's not only a large feature, but it's a very complex feature. There's a lot of vertical structure to it.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed. Charlie Henry, a scientific adviser from NOAA, said descriptions of \"layers of oil\" beneath the Gulf were \"totally untrue.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They were able to detect what we think is hydrocarbons in the water column. It was stated as oil, but it wasn't like oil you could see,\" Henry told reporters Monday afternoon.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe researchers were looking into the effects of the undersea dispersants used to break up the oil near the mouth of the well, nearly a mile beneath the surface, NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a statement issued Monday. But Lubchenco said the agency does not consider dispersants -- which have their own hazards -- \"a silver bullet.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They are used to move us towards the lesser of two environmental outcomes. Until the flow of oil is stemmed, we must take every responsible action to reduce the impact of the oil,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nSuttles said the next step in capping the well is a \"top kill\" procedure, in which a large amount of heavy \"mud\" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"That is the method we think we will be deploying later this week or this weekend,\" Suttles said. Another option -- putting debris in the well to stop the flow -- may also be utilized, he said. And once the leak is sealed, \"We intend to fill up the bottom of this well with cement and it will never be produced.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBP, as the well's owner, is responsible for stopping the underwater gusher and paying for the cleanup, and Napolitano said the company has paid more than $9.6 million so far without denying a claim.\r\r\n\r\r\nBP America CEO Lamar McKay, who appeared with Napolitano before the Homeland Security Committee, said the company", "4968": "first", "4969": "the organization does have confidential files", "4970": "Tsvangirai was taken to a hospital in Gaborone, Botswana, on Saturday", "4971": "build a tolerant and peaceful society", "4972": "Gaza", "4973": "Grand Theft Auto IV,\" released Tuesday, could give \"Iron Man\" a run for its money this weekend.\r\n\r\nThe answer could come this weekend when video game enthusiasts find out whether \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" expected to set sales records in the gaming world this week, will steal glory and revenue from a different entertainment empire: the movies.\r\n\r\nAs the hype for \"GTA IV\" continues to grow and reviews scream perfection, some speculate that the game will put a dent in Marvel Studios' opening weekend box office for \"Iron Man.\"\r\n\r\n\"GTA IV\" is the ninth incarnation of a video game in which the user acts as a criminal roaming a city.

Rod Blagojevich, bandied about a scheme to withhold state funds from the Cubs' parent Tribune Company unless the owner agreed to fire certain Chicago Tribune employees.\n\nSeven days later, according to the affidavit, she took part in a meeting about whether President-elect Barack Obama would secure a lucrative job for her if her husband appointed Obama's preferred candidate to his vacant Senate seat.\n\nU.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has said Patricia Blagojevich is not the target of the investigation of the governor's alleged attempts to sell Obama's Senate seat, pressure the Chicago Tribune and threaten to withdraw funding from a children's hospital.

She also has championed children's health care and literacy, and has parlayed her love for gardening into the State Beautification Initiative.\n\n\"As first lady, she works hard to promote initiatives that will help the families of Illinois bring up happy, healthy and successful children,\" her biography says.\n\nBlagojevich and her family have been part of the Chicago machine for decades. The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko.\n\nRezko, who was convicted in the summer on 16 counts, including fraud, money laundering and abetting bribery, is part of this week's allegations against Rod Blagojevich. Federal authorities allege Rezko is one of the conspirators with whom the governor schemed in what Fitzgerald called \"a corruption crime spree.\"\n\nThe first lady, a licensed real estate broker and appraiser with an economics degree from the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign", "5051": "Atlanta woman who was last heard from around Christmas", "5052": "support human activity.\r\n\r\nThe water was discovered in rocky environments and in craters, Mustard said.\r\n\r\n\"It's in more places and in different places than were inferred previously,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSince the Apollo missions began in the 1960s, scientists have believed the moon was virtually dry.

The mapper was a \"state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer\" that provided the first map of the entire lunar surface at high resolution, revealing the minerals of which it is made.\r\n\r\nExamining data from Chandrayaan-1, Pieters' team found signs of water at the moon's frigid poles. The researchers believe it might have migrated from elsewhere on the moon's surface, attracted by the cold, they said.\r\n\r\nTheir overall findings also were confirmed by data from a high-tech spectrometer on the Cassini spacecraft -- which also found evidence of water at lower latitudes away from the poles -- and from infrared mapping done by the Deep Impact spacecrafts -- which found trace amounts over much of the moon's surface.\r\n\r\nReports on those findings came from teams led by Roger Clark of the U.S. Geological Survey and Jessica Sunshine of the University of Maryland.\r\n\r\nThis most recent information is far more precise than any previous data, Mustard said.

Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons.\r\n\r\nHis attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is \"not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything.\"\r\n\r\nA woman identifying herself as Markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News.

Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman \"put up a fight,\" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service.\r\n\r\nShe sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified.\r\n\r\nAuthorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle.

Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and \"the case just begins to build from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,\" Conley said.\r\n\r\nThere may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. \"If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is \"bearing up,\" according to attorney Salsberg.\r\n\r\n\"It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ...

Nujood is angry, combative and yelling. Tension surrounds the home like a noose.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter much arguing with family members, Nujood  finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with CNN. Her presence is grudging, although CNN got advance permission to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was faring.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago. Then, there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child, a portrait of innocence. She had a shy smile, playful nature and a whimsical giggle.\r\r\n\r\r\nHer retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting.  Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World's Untold Stories \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nThe story was supposed to end with the divorce. There was, though, a stunning transformation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph. Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the fall of 2008, Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year, alongside some of the world's most impressive women. She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere is a tell-all book, which is to be published in more than 20 languages, and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's strength was celebrated by complete strangers. But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform?\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There is no change at all since going on television,\" Nujood says bitterly. \"I hoped there was someone to help us, but we didn't find anyone. It hasn't changed a thing. They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me. I wish I had never spoken to the media.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere was never going to be a fortune. Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school, but she refuses to attend, according to Shada Nasser, the human rights lawyer who took on the child's divorce case.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I know Nujood was absent from the school. I spoke with her father and her family. And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school. But they said, 'You know we don't have the money for the transportation. Don't have the money for the food,' \" says Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents say they've received nothing, and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I was happy I got divorced but I'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television,\" she said, adding that she feels like an outcast even among  family and friends.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly. And yet, as a wife, she was spared nothing.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I didn't want to sleep with him but he forced me to, he hit me, insulted me,\" she said. She described being married and living as a wife at such a young age as sheer torture.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood described how she was beaten and raped and how, after just a few weeks of marriage, she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement. But her parents told her they could not protect her, that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate.\r\r\n\r\r\nCNN tried to get comment from the girl's ex-husband and family, but they declined.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's parents, like many others in Yemen, struck a social bargain. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18, many times to older men, some with more than one wife.\r\r\n\r\r\nMarriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. But Nujood's parents say they did not expect the girl's new husband to demand sex from his child bride.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter several hours, a judge finally went to see her. \"And he asked me, 'what do you want' and I said 'I want a divorce' and he said 'you're married?' And I said 'yes.'\" says Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nNujood's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing, and the girl was put in the care of Nasser.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with her that she should get her divorce.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut based on the principles of Shariah law, her husband was compensated, not prosecuted. Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day.\r\r\n\r\r\nKhadije Al Salame is working to help the girl get her life back. Now a Yemeni diplomat, she too was a child bride 30 years ago. But when she left her husband, she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe said: \"It's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out, but the problem is it's too much pressure on her.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"She doesn't understand what's going on. She's a little girl and we have to understand as media people that we should leave her alone now.

This may cause symptoms such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting and nausea. Anyone who believes that he or she is having a heart attack should seek emergency medical attention.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes a heart attack is not painful, or the person experiencing it does not recognize the symptoms as heart-related, so he or she does not go to a hospital for treatment.\r\n\r\nCardiologists have only recently become attuned to the prevalence of these silent heart attacks, and research on treatment is limited. The risk factors for silent heart attacks are the same as for regular heart attacks, experts say, and include smoking, diabetes, stress and family history.  Watch CNN Health Files: Heart attacks \u00bb\r\n\r\nA new study from Duke University Medical Center shows that these silent heart attacks may occur more frequently than physicians thought.\r\n\r\nEven if a heart attack occurred in the distant past, it may still leave a signature called a Q-wave on an electrocardiogram. But there are silent heart attacks that do not have associated Q-waves.\r\n\r\nResearchers used a relatively new technique called delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance and then followed up with patients after about two years. The study was done on 185 patients who had never had a diagnosed heart attack but were suspected of having coronary artery disease.\r\n\r\nThe researchers found that 35 percent of patients had evidence of a heart attack and that silent heart attacks without Q-waves were three times more common than those that had Q-waves.\r\n\r\nPatients with non-Q-wave silent heart attacks also had 11 times higher risk of death from any cause and a 17-fold risk of death from heart problems compared with patients without any heart damage.\r\n\r\nBut experts do not recommend that people generally be screened for silent heart attacks unless they have other heart-related problems.\r\n\r\n\"Currently, there has not been a study that has demonstrated that early identification and therapy changes how patients with unrecognized heart attacks do in the future,\" said Dr. Han Kim, a cardiologist at Duke University and lead author of the study. \"If you don't know when an actual event occurred, it becomes difficult to prescribe therapy.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the study was done on a relatively small sample", "5115": "a suspected pirate attack", "5116": "$128 million", "5117": "al Qaeda in Iraq prisoners at large after a Friday jail break in Ramadi was killed in a gun battle with police Saturday, and the remaining two were arrested early Sunday, according to Ramadi police and an Iraqi Interior Ministry official", "5118": "vital Champions League group showdown", "5119": "The hospital where Duprevil was taken was unable to conduct an initial blood test", "5120": "Multiple people", "5121": "one of the greatest capos [bosses] of narcotraffic,\" Ricardo Garcia Urquiza, a member of the Juarez cartel already in police custody, Najera said.\r\n\r\nAll eight were filed before the news media Tuesday.

Watch footage of the eight arrested and weapons seized \u00bb\r\n\r\nThey were transported in a heavily armed 30-vehicle convoy late Tuesday to Guadalajara International Airport and flown to Mexico City, the official Notimex news agency reported.\r\n\r\nThe federal organized crime team in Mexico City will investigate, and the suspects will face arms charges, Najera said.\r\n\r\nZuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, a center of drug activity.\r\n\r\nIn July, she won the title Our Sinaloa Beauty. That gave her the right to compete two months later in the national Our Mexico Beauty in Monterrey, where she won \"The Election of the Queens,\" one of five special recognitions, and came in third overall.\r\n\r\nIn October, she won the title \"Hispanoamerican Queen 2008\" in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.\r\n\r\nMexican newscasts referred to her Wednesday as \"Miss Pistols\" and likened her situation to \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Nuestra Belleza Mexico Web site", "5122": "London, England (CNN) -- Formula 1 will continue to take place in Britain", "5123": "the seventh anniversary of the attacks", "5124": "32 ounces", "5125": "Kate Gosselin"}
