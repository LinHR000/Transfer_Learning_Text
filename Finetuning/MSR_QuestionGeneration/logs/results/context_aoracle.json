Some are born with an adventurous streak, an insatiable curiosity that can only be quelled through discovery, while others seek out adventures as a means of conquering the demons within: fear, boredom, stagnation, a sort of dry rot of the soul.\r\n\r\nWe see adventurous people as being somehow different from ourselves: stronger, braver, tougher, fitter. They are versions of our best selves: the doers in life, the fearless, those who go over the mountain and come back to tell us what's on the other side.\r\n\r\nWhile we may think the true adventurers are a species apart, we are all adventurers at heart -- yet sometimes the urge is stifled by modern life.\r\n\r\nThe lust for adventure is planted in childhood. How many of us sat enthralled under the blankets as our parents read us the adventures of the Famous Five, \"Treasure Island,\" \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" \"The Swiss Family Robinson,\" \"Tarzan\" and \"Peter Pan\"?\r\n\r\nChildren weaned on such stories may be forgiven for assuming adulthood is one long adventure that swings wildly between jungles, swamps, deserted islands and alpine heights.\r\n\r\nYet modern life is increasingly sedentary and safety-conscious. The desire for comfort and convenience ameliorates our contradictory urge to explore.\r\n\r\nA few have it thrust upon them: stranded in an inhospitable place, lost in a jungle or called up for combat -- and they find themselves dropped in an adventure that they may not have chosen; but for the main part, adventure comes to those who seek it.\r\n\r\nDr. James Thompson, a senior lecturer in psychology at University College London, says seeking adventure is more common \"amongst people who are extroverted, who are outgoing, who are sociable, because one of the things they need -- apart from the excitement of people -- is excitement generally.\"\r\n\r\nBut if you think adventure is something that only happens to other people; that you are too unfit to climb a mountain, too scared to sail across the open sea, too nervous to travel through a country where you can't speak the language; perhaps you should rethink. After all, having an adventure could be good for you.\r\n\r\nPsychologists have linked adventure-seeking with a range of positive qualities. Adventure can:\r\n\r\nFollowing the stories of this age's greatest adventurers such as polar explorer Douglas Mawson, Everest climber Edmund Hillary and mountaineer Reinhold Messner, we are encouraged not just to follow their paths up mountains or along rock faces -- they also inspire us to take more risks, to seize more from each day.\r\n\r\nWho could fail to be inspired after watching CNN interview the world's greatest living mountaineer, Reinhold Messner?\r\n\r\nIn 1980, Messner was the first person to ascend Mount Everest", "255": "President Bush", "256": "Lance Battreal, Mark Booher and Charles Smith", "257": "Tom Hanks:", "258": "Monday afternoon were Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper; NFL free agent Corey Smith, who played for the Detroit Lions for the past three seasons;", "259": "ski accident.", "260": "cell phone systems around the world and not just with AT&T.", "261": "Fabrizio Miccoli", "262": "he's releasing the information to help the government's fight against fraud.", "263": "1868,", "264": "inadequate.", "265": "First Amendment", "266": "U.S. assistance for hurricane victims.", "267": "3-1-1", "268": "CNN's Sean Callebs", "269": "\"Best Careers\"", "270": "Michelle Obama", "271": "three", "272": "\"step aside,\"", "273": "Vienna, Austria,", "274": "Institutions evolve in market economies", "275": "\"Paranormal Activity\"", "276": "Leona Helmsley", "277": "8,000", "278": "higher toll of 195", "279": "This option is only available at select Wendy's,", "280": "John Kiriakou", "281": "debris won't threaten the international space station,", "282": "Mike", "283": "Great Depression levels", "284": "Mumbai,", "285": "7.6-magnitude", "286": "swap deal", "287": "Arline Kercher,", "288": "$18.", "289": "dependence on unmanned", "290": "Symbionese Liberation Army", "291": "Robin van Persie", "292": "girl", "293": "Luca di Montezemolo", "294": "Natasha Richardson,", "295": "Le Scrapbooking Scrapbooking", "296": "$140.7 million", "297": "10", "298": "Army officials", "299": "fly a fifth and final space shuttle mission", "300": "The 32-floor", "301": "Concerns that a delay in the upcoming Iraqi elections could put a dent in scheduled withdrawals", "302": "the media", "303": "The issue", "304": "\"in our system, justice", "305": "people fleeing wars in Afghanistan and Somalia,", "306": "McKinney", "307": "Sir Alex Ferguson", "308": "Latin American leaders and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.", "309": "vibrio cholera.", "310": "MySpace.", "311": "Sandeep Kapoor,", "312": "she votes pretty similarly to me.", "313": "permanent weight loss.", "314": "Grand Beach, Michigan,", "315": "solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle.", "316": "Afghanistan", "317": "U.S. Coast Guard", "318": "hypothermia.", "319": "20", "320": "Raghad Hussein", "321": "cars, transit buses and tractor-trailers", "322": "The Aztecs,", "323": "assaulting a man", "324": "counterfeit goods.", "325": "Mercer 2011", "326": "John Yettaw,", "327": "Police", "328": "two of the four Impressionist paintings stolen", "329": "stresses", "330": "Infantino", "331": "Park Ji-Sung", "332": "43.4 million", "333": "Thirteen", "334": "Iraqis rush to a car bomb explosion", "335": "Leona Lewis", "336": "the allegations made by these attorneys.", "337": "Colonel Mustapha Nooh,", "338": "deny al Qaeda a safe haven, reverse the Taliban's momentum and strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government.\r\r\n\r\r\nHere is how he said he plans", "339": "The FBI", "340": "more than 900", "341": "many travelers", "342": "Lang Lang", "343": "conditional release,", "344": "Jarrett also credited the president", "345": "\"Sully Lite,\"", "346": "General", "347": "government playing a positive role in health care.", "348": "\"Mad Men,\"", "349": "Blackwater personnel", "350": "\"a reminder that we are at war with extremists who will murder innocent people to achieve their ideological objectives.\"", "351": "striking as ever.", "352": "young Catholic and Protestant men", "353": "Indian Street Bridge", "354": "Twitter", "355": "People have lost confidence.", "356": "Gen.

They knew what they had to do,\" Higgins said.\n\nNeither Sullenberger nor Skiles attended the news conference.\n\nEarlier in the day, the NTSB revealed the content of communications between the cockpit and controllers at LaGuardia in the brief period during which the incident unfolded.\n\n\"This is cactus 1549, hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines,\" Sullenberger told controllers at approximately 3:27 p.m. Thursday. \"We're turning back towards LaGuardia.\"\n\nControllers immediately began preparations to clear a runway for an emergency landing, but less than a minute later, Sullenberger reported that the aircraft wouldn't make it, Higgins said.\n\nThe last communication from the plane to controllers, Higgins said, was the pilot saying, \"We're gonna be in the Hudson.\"  Watch a former pilot tell how to water-land a plane \u00bb\n\nHiggins also quoted two of the flight's attendants, who were in jump seats at the front of the aircraft when they heard a loud thud shortly after takeoff.\n\n\"It was a sound that neither one of them had ever heard before,\" Higgins said. \"They said all the engine noise ceased. They described it as complete silence, like a library.\"\n\nEfforts to raise the jetliner from the river proved successful late Saturday, as cranes lifted it clear of the water about 11:30 p.m. ET following several hours of work by crews in frigid conditions.\n\nVideo from the scene showed the right side of the aircraft with the engine intact but its covering mangled. It was not clear visually whether the damage was from an in-flight incident or from the landing impact.\n\nInvestigators planned to tow the plane on a barge to an undisclosed location for their examination.  Watch water wash over the plane \u00bb\n\nSearchers using sonar think they have found the left engine on the river bottom. Divers will try to confirm the finding, Higgins said.

We didn't think this week would be any different.\"\r\n\r\nThe finale of \"The Wire\" has earned intense interest from fans who have followed the Baltimore-set show zealously since its premiere in 2002. The critically lauded show has never matched the audience of other HBO programs, such as \"The Sopranos,\" but its viewers are a particularly passionate lot, following the show's motley crew of cops, drug dealers, struggling children, politicians and journalists with deeply probing blogs and running commentary.  Gallery: Get to know the characters of \"The Wire\" \u00bb\r\n\r\nThey want to delve deeper into the show's portrayal of what creator David Simon has described as \"what it feels like to live in the American city.\"\r\n\r\nMonday morning, the official HBO Web site confirmed that the series finale would not be made available early, but would premiere during its regularly scheduled 9 p.m. Sunday time slot.\r\n\r\nWhile the decision to not release the show early was a surprise to fans, it was one made back at the beginning of the final season at the urging of Simon, executives at HBO said.\r\n\r\nHBO vice president Dave Baldwin said that in seasons past, spoilers about season finales and the episodes themselves had leaked onto the Web, so Simon requested a change in the schedule.\r\n\r\nBaldwin acknowledged that there were many angry fans -- some of whom are calling HBO liars -- but attributed their rancor to their passion for the show. But what could he say?\r\n\r\n\"Forgive us, we thought we were doing the right thing,\" Baldwin said. \"And anything else that a husband would say to his wife [in] begging for forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nThe curtain of secrecy around \"The Wire\" finale is one Simon intends to keep tightly drawn until the show begins Sunday night.\r\n\r\nAaron Barnhart, TV critic for The Kansas City Star, found out just how tightly guarded Simon intended to keep it when he posted an entry to his blog about the advance copy of the finale he received.\r\n\r\nBarnhart told CNN he intended not to spoil the show for fans, only discussing small details of the finale. But what Barnhart thought was a small detail -- the finale's closing song -- turned out to be otherwise for Simon.\r\n\r\nLess than three hours after the blog entry was posted, Barnhart received a voice mail from someone identifying himself as Simon, imploring him to take the post down, because there is a great deal of anticipation and betting on what the song will be.\r\n\r\nBarnhart said he had no idea the closing segment was such a big deal, saying it hadn't made a big impact on him in the past, but he realized that doesn't mean it isn't a huge deal to other fans.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is a token of the strong bond that this show has to its small niche of fans,\" he said. \"[Simon] wants to reward the devotion of those fans with a moment like that. He's decided it's important, and the fact that it's not important to me doesn't entitle me to spoil it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile some \"Wire\" fans who were duped out of an early release ranted on HBO message boards, Facebook and MySpace, Wallen said he and his friends decided to find the positive in it all.\r\n\r\n\"I guess the consolation is that we have five extra days to be excited and talk about the

student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\r\n\r\nPolice said UNC student body President Eve Carson was taken from her home and killed.\r\n\r\nA grand jury indicted Demario James Atwater on October 27 on federal charges of carjacking resulting in death, carrying and using firearms in relation to carjacking, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and possessing a short-barreled shotgun not properly registered to him.\r\n\r\nHe also faces state first-degree murder charges in Orange County, North Carolina, along with 18-year-old Lawrence Alvin Lovette.\r\n\r\n\"Both federal and state law violations are implicated in the tragic events of March 5, 2008, and we will vigorously prosecute the violations of federal law committed in connection with the death of Eve Marie Carson,\" said Anna Mills Wagoner, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, at the time of Atwater's indictment.\r\n\r\nAn autopsy report showed that Carson, an honors student, had multiple gunshot wounds when she was found lying on a Chapel Hill street. The autopsy report listed six gunshot wounds but said two of the wounds were probably from the same bullet.\r\n\r\nCourt documents released in the North Carolina case said Carson was taken from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with ATM access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of March 5.\r\n\r\nApplications filed for search warrants said a confidential informant told police that Atwater said he and Lovette entered Carson's home through an open door and forced her to accompany them in her car. The informant said she had talked with Atwater after a picture was shown on television of someone attempting to use Carson's ATM card at a convenience store two days after her body was found.\r\n\r\nThe informant said the two men drove Carson to an ATM, obtained her PIN from her and then shot her. The witness told police that Atwater said the two got about $1,400 from Carson's account. Bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period, the documents said.\r\n\r\nOrange County District Attorney Jim Woodall has said he also will seek the death penalty against Atwater, according to the Raleigh News and Observer.

Ted Kennedy hit the airwaves to say it was \"indefensible\" he didn't immediately report the accident.\r\n\r\nMary Jo Kopechne, 28, drowned after Kennedy drove his Oldsmobile off a bridge following a regatta party in July 1969. The incident on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, helped dash the youngest Kennedy brother's chances at the Oval Office in 1972 and 1980.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was more forgiving than the rest of the nation, however, backing Kennedy by a 3-to-2 margin in his 1970 bid to keep his Senate seat. That his brothers, John and Robert, had been assassinated in recent years may have been a factor, experts said.  Watch Kennedy attend brother Robert's funeral \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"Great expectations and great tragedy has always been the storyline of the Kennedys,\" said Christopher Arterton, dean of George Washington University's graduate school of political management. \"The people of Massachusetts were prepared to forgive a lot of transgressions.\"\r\n\r\nKennedy vanished to the family compound for days after the incident, huddling with advisers before emerging the following week to plead guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. A judge suspended his two-month jail sentence.\r\n\r\nCritics saw the plea as an attempt to stifle details that would have emerged during a trial.\r\n\r\nIn a display of the senator's legendary oratory, he delivered a nationally televised explanation and apology, saying it was \"indefensible\" that he hadn't called police until the day after the accident.  See how Chappaquiddick fit into Kennedy's legacy \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"If at any time, the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character or his ability, with or without justification, he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duty and should not continue in office,\" Kennedy said.\r\n\r\nJim Baughman, author of \"The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America since 1941,\" said he recalls Kennedy's address being \"less an explanation to the country than to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nThe nation's response was tepid. According to a Time-Harris poll in August 1969, about 44 percent of respondents said Kennedy failed \"to tell the real truth,\" 51 percent said his explanation was inadequate and 77 percent said he was wrong not to report the accident immediately.\r\n\r\nHowever, 58 percent of respondents said \"he has suffered, been punished and should be given the benefit of the doubt.\"  Watch a timeline of Kennedy's tragedies, triumphs \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"I think the national repercussions would have been more severe [today],\" Baughman said.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, the national media were dominated by three TV networks and a handful of magazines and newspapers.

Connor, the boy destined to lead humanity's battle against Armageddon, gets jolted into the future -- the one he was supposed to lead. But here, he has no identity. No one has heard of him.\r\n\r\nIn this new future, he'll be fighting alongside his father, his uncle and a girl who looks just like the robot he came into the future to save. None of them has any idea who he is.\r\n\r\nConfused? Don't be. It was a daring, surprising, brilliant cliffhanger for a show that's gained a loyal following, particularly among people like me who are in awe of it. It also opens the door to anyone who hasn't discovered this show yet, allowing for a fresh start.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it may be too late. For fans, the big question is whether the \"Chronicles\" will be back, or canceled for inadequate ratings. We find out in a couple of weeks when Fox announces its schedule. The speculation online doesn't look good.\r\n\r\nEnding on this Season 2 cliffhanger would be a shame.\r\n\r\nWhen Fox picked up this \"Terminator,\" it took on one of the most successful sci-fi franchises in modern entertainment history. It courted \"Terminator\" fans, as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep, high-quality TV storytelling. Ending on this \"what happens now\" cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise's history.\r\n\r\nBut of bigger concern, of course, is that \"The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last. And that's thanks to Josh Friedman, the inspired executive producer.\r\n\r\nFor him, \"Terminator\" isn't about special effects and metal monsters. It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost.\r\n\r\nWithout clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified.\r\n\r\nIt's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in?

India's richest woman is ready to answer your questions.\r\n\r\nKiran Mazumdar-Shaw, founder of biotech pharaceutical company Biotech answers your questions, below.\r\n\r\nYours is a very inspiring story. Could you tell us more about what challenges you had to overcome to bring Biocon to a global level? Vishala Vasandani\r\n\r\nMazumdar Shaw: My journey started 30 years ago at a time when I had to face credibility challenges that pertained to my gender, my inexperience as a business entrepreneur and my unfamiliar biotechnology-based business model. My business evolved in tandem with challenges.\r\n\r\nOnce I overcame these credibility challenges, I faced technological challenges of trying to build a Biotech business in a country that had infrastructure that was too primitive to support a high tech industry that demanded uninterrupted power supply, high quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, advanced scientific skills etc.\r\n\r\nOver the next 10 years, we systematically addressed these challenges and built a self contained enterprise that had captive power and water supply, state of the art labs and facilities and a team of highly experienced scientists and engineers capable of delivering world class research and technologies.\r\n\r\nToday, our challenges address those posed by new medical wisdom: addressing unmet medical needs, researching new drugs, new drug delivery systems and new therapies. Overcoming each of these phases has been a rich learning experience that has helped us to develop world class expertise in biotechnology. Innovation and quality have been integral to our business ethos.\r\n\r\nCan Biocon's oral insulin IN-105 replace traditional and painful needle based insulin delivery system for type1 diabetics? Can a diabetic who is taking insulin by needle based delivery system hope for change in near future?  Ajay Kumar Singh\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: Oral Insulin is not just about delivering Insulin in a tablet. It is about delivering Insulin very rapidly to the liver (hepato-delivery) which is the main organ responsible for glycemic control in our body. Injectable Insulin takes approximately 30 minutes to act. Oral Insulin takes approximately 5 minutes to act which mimics how non-diabetics respond to glucose uptake when food is consumed. This will help both Type I and Type II diabetics to manage their diabetes better.\r\n\r\nWe hope that early intervention with Oral Insulin will help to manage Diabetes especially in Type II diabetics much more effectively than is being done by oral diabetic agents like Metformin, Sulphonyl Ureas and Glitazones which stimulate the pancreas to produce Insulin.\r\n\r\nThis is unlike oral Insulin which will allow a poorly functioning pancreas to rest and hopefully help to revive Insulin secreting beta cells. Should our Oral Insulin program succeed, this will revolutionize Diabetes therapy in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you had to do the IPO again what would you do differently and when can we see Biocon listed in NASDAQ?  Harish Swaminathan\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I don't believe so. I think we got the valuation we were expecting through an Indian listing. A NASDAQ listing is only something we will address when one of our branded drugs are close to commercialization in either the U.S. or European markets. Today NASDAQ is risk averse and not valuing biotech companies any better than the BSE or NSE.\r\n\r\nI am so humbled by your story. What does it take as a woman to get to where you are today? What obstacles did you have to overcome, especially in an industry that is deemed to be a \"man's world\"? Would women setting up business in India today find it easier than you did? Irene Gonza, Uganda\r\n\r\nMazumdar-Shaw: I believe that women need to believe in themselves. I set up Biocon with a spirit of challenge and a deep sense of purpose. The challenge was to break the gender bias in the business world.\r\n\r\nMy sense of purpose was to create a Biotech business in a country like India", "5064": "his slaying by government forces", "5065": "Kallis", "5066": "serious brain infection and even death.", "5067": "how they will get their next meals.", "5068": "Harlem's Apollo Theater", "5069": "September 11, 2001,", "5070": "displaying magazine pages,", "5071": "Ed McMahon", "5072": "Kashmir.", "5073": "Canada", "5074": "Patrick Dempsey,", "5075": "more than $100,000 a year,", "5076": "Human", "5077": "death penalty", "5078": "\"\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs and people in service industries,", "5079": "Savvy cyber criminals are taking advantage of our increasing reliance on computers and the Internet.", "5080": "abuse toward Christians in Iraq.", "5081": "Renee Zellweger", "5082": "Adam Sandler", "5083": "complications of cosmetic surgery,", "5084": "15,", "5085": "food stamps", "5086": "3-year-old", "5087": "2008 Summer Olympics", "5088": "At least six", "5089": "\"This is an employee who has had a stellar record,\"", "5090": "The arrests were part of a large police operation", "5091": "Robert Baden-Powell", "5092": "Luxembourg City", "5093": "as Sadness", "5094": "China", "5095": "month-long pilot program,", "5096": "lifting the ban.", "5097": "vehicular homicide,", "5098": "pizza sub", "5099": "Philip Markoff,", "5100": "the cable provider company,", "5101": "five to eight", "5102": "Human Rights Watch", "5103": "\"It's just a total waste of money,\"", "5104": "1864", "5105": "30 pounds,", "5106": "The goats", "5107": "combat brush while protecting a threatened species.", "5108": "Yemen,", "5109": "strangling his wife and two young sons", "5110": "three", "5111": "Wallen,", "5112": "economy  to environmental-themed businesses.", "5113": "64 percent", "5114": "185", "5115": "a suspected pirate attack", "5116": "$128 million", "5117": "Abdul Aleem Abdulwahab and Lazem Mohammed Ali,", "5118": "Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "5119": "24-year-old", "5120": "Multiple people", "5121": "\"Miss Pistols\"", "5122": "Britain", "5123": "Virginia", "5124": "32 ounces,", "5125": "Kate Gosselin"}
