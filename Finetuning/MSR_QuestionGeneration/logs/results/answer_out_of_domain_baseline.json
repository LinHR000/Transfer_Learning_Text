The move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their TV sets and heading straight to the Web -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows . The service , named Fancast XFINITY TV ( formerly called TV Everywhere ) , is the biggest cable industry initiative to keep people from skipping traditional TV service in the United States . \" I watch TV online every day . I find it more convenient than my regular TV ... , \" Michael Heard , a self-employed computer repairman from Atlanta , Georgia , said via e-mail . \" I 'm usually watching TV on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another . \" And also my time is important , so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. is n't convenient .

Now , Comcast is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content . It is available to all Comcast customers , so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service . Heard said he does n't expect to give up Hulu , though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast .

NASA says debris wo n't threaten the international space station , seen here from Endeavour in November 2008 . Mission controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston warned earlier that a piece of the Kosmos 1275 was to pass about 1/2 mile from the space station early Tuesday morning . But after further study , NASA determined no evasive action would be needed , said Paul Dye , flight director for the space shuttle Discovery , which is en route to the station . \" The latest tracking information showed it is outside of our area of concern , so the station is going to be right where we expected it to be , \" Dye told reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas . Discovery lifted off from Florida on Sunday for a scheduled docking at 5:13 p.m . ET Tuesday . The spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said LeRoy Cain , the shuttle program 's deputy manager . The dimensions of the satellite debris were not known Monday . The object was expected to pass \" on the fringes \" of the 2 km-by-25 km-by-25 km ( 1.25 mile-by-15 mile-by-15 mile ) safety zone controllers monitor , Dye said . \" It 's a very low probability of hit -- less than one in 100,000 , \" he said . The space shuttle Discovery is currently headed toward the station for a scheduled docking Tuesday , but the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said LeRoy Cain , the shuttle program 's deputy manager .

I know this is so because my friend Dr. Karen Hsiao Ashe , an internationally renowned Alzheimer 's disease researcher at the University of Minnesota , has developed a research road map that calls for bringing together a group of the world 's foremost laboratory and clinical investigators in the field to make prevention a reality by 2020 . This achievable goal adds \" hope \" to the vocabulary of Alzheimer 's disease and holds the promise that my children and yours will never suffer its hardship . My son , Alec , is an artist like his late grandmother . His paintings are large and uncompromising , stunning in texture , original in design . He 's got the real thing . He 's got \" it , \" just as she had . But what if he also has something else , like the APOE-e4 gene , known to increase the risk of Alzheimer 's ? What if he is in line to inherit this devastating disease ? What I could barely endure happening to my mother , I know I could not possibly endure happening to my son . So , like my friend Karen , I embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for Alzheimer 's disease . Anything short of that is too risky . Karen is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective , widely available interventions . She compares Alzheimer 's disease prevention to the polio vaccine : \" Had a vaccine not been developed for polio , hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe . Similarly , not only is treatment of Alzheimer 's likely to be less effective than prevention , it 's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive , \" she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine . Karen and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility : a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer 's .

Even if Moreno-Ocampo were successful in adding genocide to the warrant , he would still face a difficult task in proving the charges at trial , said Mark Ellis , the executive director of the International Bar Association . \" Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet ( than war crimes and crimes against humanity ) because you have to show in proving genocide that there was an intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race , \" Ellis told CNN . \" Obviously the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial", "190": "18", "191": "asphyxiated", "192": "Sen.

Isaac Toussie , 36 , was convicted in 2001 of mail fraud and of making false statements to the Department of Housing and Urban Development that stemmed from the mortgage scheme . The White House initially announced the pardon Tuesday afternoon , immediately setting off a firestorm of criticism from angry homeowners and investors , as well as government watchdog organizations quick to note Toussie 's ties to prominent Republican officeholders . Among the questions now being asked are : \u2022 Why did n't the White House conduct a more thorough investigation of Toussie 's background ? \u2022 Why did White House Counsel Fred Fielding circumvent the typical pardon application process by directly considering Toussie 's clemency request instead of leaving it to the Justice Department ? \u2022 Did Toussie get special treatment because of his political connections ? Watch why Bush withdrew the pardon \u00bb Toussie and his father , also a developer , are defendants in a lawsuit filed in New York federal court on behalf of more than 400 minority home purchasers who allege a conspiracy involving racial steering , racketeering and fraud related to homes the Toussies built on Staten Island , attorney Peter Seidman told CNN . Seidman , a partner in a law firm representing the plaintiffs , said he was \" very pleased \" with President Bush 's order for a review of the pardon . \" It [ the pardon ] was a bitter pill for the home purchasers to swallow , \" he said . The Toussies had previously been accused of conspiring with lenders and others to build and sell substandard homes -- a charge they denied . According to a senior administration official , the White House learned new information about Toussie 's case Tuesday night -- hours after the pardon was announced . Specifically , the White House learned , according to the official , \" additional information about the nature of fraud [ Toussie ] carried out . \" The White House also learned that Toussie 's father had made numerous contributions to leading GOP politicians . In 2008 , Toussie 's father donated almost $ 40,000 to Arizona Sen. John McCain , Minnesota Sen . Norm Coleman , Oregon Sen. Gordon Smith and Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor . White House press secretary Dana Perino issued a statement Wednesday saying that \" based on information that has subsequently come to light , \" Bush had told the Justice Department 's pardon attorney not to act on the pardon extended to Toussie . Instead , Perino said , \" The president believes that the pardon attorney should have an opportunity to review this case before a decision on clemency is made . \" While almost all pardon requests go through the Justice Department , the Constitution allows the president to grant a pardon or commutation to any individual for any reason . Perino said Toussie 's pardon was withdrawn before it reached the final stage of the process .

Using a campaign of limited showings , social media and word-of-mouth fan buzz , the film has managed to become a breakout hit without the aid of a glitzy marketing campaign -- or even a traditional movie trailer . According to Variety , the very low-budget film ( it reportedly cost $ 11,000 ) , which played in fewer than 200 theaters , raked in $ 7.1 million over the weekend -- a record for a limited-release film . The film had an impressive $ 44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend . \" We think it 's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle , \" said Kevin Carr , a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects . \" It 's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns . \" \" Paranormal Activity \" bills itself as \" the first-ever major film release demanded by you . \" The movie , which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008 , was acquired by Dreamworks ( then a part of Paramount Pictures ) two years ago . The studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors . But after studio executives , including Steven Spielberg , viewed it , they decided the film could stand more or less as it was ( though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending ) . The movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns , and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick , which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted . Paramount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film . Peli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie . \" I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support , \" Peli said on the video . \" It 's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake . \" More than a million people have heeded the call . The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films . Megan Colligan , co-president of marketing for Paramount , said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film , so its marketing had to be tightly targeted . Moreover , condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge , so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film , said Josh Greenstein , who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount . \" It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie , \" he said . \" When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie , so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential . \" The unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off . \" The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [ to market the film ] , \" Colligan said . \" The film is selling itself , \" Greenstein added . Critics have also taken notice , and have showered the film with good reviews . In giving the movie an A-minus grade , Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \" With its this-is-really-happening vibe , 'Paranormal Activity ' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich\u00e9s . The fear is real , all right , because the fear is really in you . \" Overall , the film has earned a strong 85 percent approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes . Moviegoers agree .

Check out Rajiim Gross ' iReport \" It actually scared the hell out of me , \" Gross said . \" I saw it during the day and I would hate to be someone who went home after seeing it late at night . \" Gross said he believed the studio was smart to leverage the Internet to spread the word . Watch Rajiim Gross ' review of 'Paranormal Activity ' \u00bb \" The best advertising is word of mouth , \" Gross said . \" People tell 10 friends , they go see it and they tell 10 more friends and soon you have an entire community who wants to see it . \" Carr , whose Film School Rejects site has been following the frenzy , said the movie \" gets inside of your head \" and benefits from the traditional fan support that horror films often enjoy . That , coupled with the big cinema thrills and chills , should add up to continued box office success , Carr said . \" Watching it with 250 strangers in a movie theater and getting everybody to jump at the same time definitely has an effect , \" he said . \"", "276": "Leona Helmsley The notoriously egomaniacal hotelier", "277": "8,000", "278": "British identification documents", "279": "Grand Slam , which is four patties stacked on a bun .

After the president 's speech , Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion .

She joins three other poets who have read at inaugural ceremonies -- Robert Frost in 1961 for John F. Kennedy 's inauguration and Maya Angelou and Miller Williams , who read at Bill Clinton 's 1993 and 1997 inaugurations .

Her father is Clifford Alexander , secretary of the Army in the Carter administration , and her mother teaches history at George Washington University . Her brother is an adviser to Obama 's transition team . Alexander 's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from \" American Sublime \" ( Graywolf Press ) : Poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner , overhear on the bus , God / in the details , the only way to get from here to there . / Poetry ( and now my voice is rising ) is not all love , love , love , / and I 'm sorry the dog died . Poetry ( here I hear myself loudest ) / is the human voice , and are we not of interest to each other ? Alexander spoke Friday to CNN.com . CNN : What do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this ? Alexander : I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language , the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause , a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle . CNN : You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago ? Alexander : In the community in Hyde Park , he and Mrs. Obama were just people I 'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about , and we were of a generation . ... He was in the law school , and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work did n't really cross so much . ... [ We were in ] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s , thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills , intellectual skills , skills in the discipline of law , in literature , artistic skills . That was the common ground , thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community . CNN : And you did it by writing ? Alexander : By writing and teaching . I 've been a professor for many years now , and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale . ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in . It 's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years . CNN : We have this historical moment , the 80th birthday of the Rev . Martin Luther King , the inauguration of the first African-American president . How does that resonate with you ? Alexander : It 's amazing , is n't it ? I just shake my head and say , \" Is n't that something ? \" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president . At the same time , this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation 's history . I ca n't tell you how many older people have said to me , \" I never thought I 'd live to see this day . \" The fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there 's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us . CNN : What 's ahead of us ? Alexander : Oh my goodness , so much . There are wars or conflicts in many different places , there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places , there 's the tremendous challenge of the economy . ... The larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are , if not post-partisan -- because I do n't think there 's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions . Within our communities large and small , making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we 're going to have to do in order to make things better .

But Lang Lang is not concerned about that . His mission is to spread a love of music and popularize classical works . Revealed follows him to the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland , where he teams up with his hero , Jazz legend Hancock . The feeling of admiration is entirely mutual , and for Hancock who has not played classical repertoire in many years , he is feeling out of his depth . \" Lang Lang is totally amazing , I 'm pretty terrified to be up on stage playing alongside him . I 've never practiced so much in my life ! \" Backstage another Jazz legend Quincy Jones has popped by for the concert , remarking , \" Lang Lang has taken the world by storm . This is as good as it gets . \" Only 27 years old , Lang Lang is high on life and music , and hungry for as much adventure as he can get his hands on . His energy and enthusiasm rubs off on all those he comes into contact with , and as Revealed quickly discovers , a trail of laughter , hugs and applause seems to follow him everywhere he goes .

Air marshals describe an agency in chaos , where bored and frustrated marshals focus more on internal squabbles than watching for bad guys . The marshals refused to let their identities be known , for fear of retaliation in an agency that is driven , they say , by intimidation and favoritism . After a Nigerian 's attempt to blow up an airliner preparing to land in Detroit , Michigan , on Christmas Day , a growing number of critics have called for either the elimination or a total overhaul of the agency . Last week , President Obama asked Congress for an additional $ 85 million to boost the air marshals program , known by its acronym FAMS , after the foiled attack aboard the jet coming from the Netherlands . U.S. officials have charged Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab with attempting to blow up the airliner . He was subdued by passengers and crew . No air marshals were on the flight , generating additional criticism of the service . Despite efforts by Obama and assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that FAMS will become more effective , one air marshal told CNN , \" Nothing 's particularly changed for me since Christmas Day , or ( for ) a big percentage of people that I work with . Everything is pretty much the same . \" In January , Napolitano testified before a Senate committee , where she vowed , \" We will strengthen the capacity of aviation law enforcement , including the Federal Air Marshal Service . \" International flights are considered to have the highest risk . However , air marshals from a half dozen FAMS field offices said the agency continues to assign marshals to short , regional routes on small jets . The marshals told CNN that lots of short-haul flights make the agency look more productive on paper . The marshals said if someone dares criticize a manager , he or she can be banished to what they call \" Team America , \" referring to the regional trips . Managers and favored employees receive the perk of traveling international routes , they said . Repeatedly , air marshals reported that the decision on who flies on what flights are driven by extra pay for managers , and office politics -- not security . Despite repeated requests , FAMS and its parent agency , the Transportation Security Administration , declined to give CNN an interview . However , TSA spokesman Nelson Minerly provided a statement , saying , \" The Transportation Security Administration 's Federal Air Marshals are strategically deployed aboard U.S. flagged air carriers to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public . \" The Federal Air Marshal Service is currently training and deploying fellow federal law enforcement officers to support the administration 's enhancement in aviation security . Federal Air Marshals and these additional highly trained officers are being deployed aboard an increasing number of flights worldwide to keep air travel safe , \" Minerly wrote . Rep. John Duncan , R-Tennessee , is one of FAMS ' harshest critics . \" It 's just a total waste of money , \" he told CNN in a recent interview . \" I know that any time you create a federal bureaucracy , it just grows and grows , and the appropriation just goes up and up , but ... look at the record . They have n't done anything . \" \" I had the statistic from last year , \" the Republican said . \" They made four arrests for an appropriation of $ 800 million . It came out to more than $ 200 million per arrest . It 's just ridiculous . \" Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas , does n't want FAMS eliminated , she wants it revamped . \" If we 've got those kinds of problems , we need to get a ready broom and sweep , \" she said . \" The only way we are going to ensure the security and safety of the American people is that we have staff par excellence , and I know they are out there . \" Although the actual number of air marshals is classified , it has been widely reported that the number of air marshals covering 28,000 flights per day is fewer than 4,000 . Even with a generous calculation , the marshals only cover 5 percent of flights , according to CNN assessments . CNN has been studying FAMS for three years , and during that time , air marshals have accused managers of using creative accounting to pad the numbers given to Congress .

The journey began with music in Gary , Indiana . Joseph Jackson , the patriarch , played in a short-lived band called the Falcons ( no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett ) in the 1950s . His primary job , however , was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel . Katherine Jackson , the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949 , tended to the couple 's large family : Rebbie , Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , La Toya , Marlon , Michael and Randy , all born between 1950 and 1961 . Daughter Janet arrived in 1966 . By that time , the three oldest boys -- Jackie , Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group , which Marlon and Michael eventually joined . Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he 'd found elusive . Joseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster . He drove his sons hard , forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity . He was n't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child , Michael . \" My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day , \" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993 . He said his father also beat him : \" He was very strict , very hard , very stern . ... There 's been times when he 'd come to see me , I 'd get sick , I 'd start to regurgitate . \" He quickly said , imagining his father 's reaction , \" Please do n't be mad at me . \" Joseph Jackson disputed the word \" beat , \" but did n't question Michael 's account . \" I whipped him with a switch and a belt , \" he told the BBC in 2003 . He added , \" I never beat him . You beat someone with a stick . \" In a 2005 interview with CNN 's Larry King , Jermaine defended his father 's actions . \" We grew up like any other black family . You did something , you got your butt tore up , and it was n't tore up , it was just , you got a spanking , \" he said . \" I will say this . He kept us off of the streets . He kept us away from drugs . He kept us away from gangs and ... we 've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world . \" By 1968 , when Michael turned 10 , the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine . They 'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \" chitlin circuit \" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group . Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \" the last big stars to come off my assembly line , \" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site . The group shot out of the gate with four No . 1 hits and gained a huge fan base , along with an animated TV show . But success took its toll , particularly when it was n't so easy to come by . In the mid-1970s , the band -- minus Jermaine , who 'd married Gordy 's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records , where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff . The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions , which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \" Enjoy Yourself . \" \" It was a collaboration , \" Gamble said . \" They all participated in creating . Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians . \" Huff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting , complete with a \" fantastic meal \" cooked by Katherine Jackson . \" I 've got nothing but respect for the father , \" added Gamble . \" He 's a great man . He made something out of nothing . \" Even during that era , however , Michael was standing out . Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded . Going solo with Quincy Jones producing , as he did in 1979 , was the right move , Gamble and Huff said . The family dynamics kept changing as the siblings grew older . After Michael 's \" Thriller \" became the biggest album of all time , the brothers -- including Jermaine -- regrouped for a new album , \" Victory , \" and accompanying tour . But Michael , now the undisputed draw , disagreed with some of the tour plans and ended up donating his earnings to charity . Michael 's brightened spotlight boosted the careers of his siblings ; even Rebbie had a hit . But it was Janet who broke out with the most success , including the No . 1 singles \" Miss You Much , \" \" Black Cat \" and \" Again \" in the 1980s and '90s . With the increased interest in the Jacksons came tabloid scrutiny of the family 's every move . When La Toya appeared nude in Playboy magazine , the story made headlines . She later criticized Michael and was on the outs for several years . Jermaine put out a song called \" Word to the Badd , \" an attack on Michael , in 1991 ; he later changed the lyrics . Janet 's relationships were probed in detail , as were the brothers ' marriages . And Michael , of course , was seen as increasingly eccentric , his personality overwhelming his music . But for all their own bickering , the family closed ranks when a member was attacked .

Barack Obama received key endorsements Friday from a top former Clinton administration official and two former Democratic senators . Robert Reich , a former Labor Secretary under President Clinton , endorsed Sen. Obama Friday . Robert Reich , a former Clinton cabinet member and longtime friend of the former president , formally endorsed Obama 's White House bid , saying that \" my conscience wo n't let me be silent any longer . \" \" Although Hillary Clinton has offered solid and sensible policy proposals , Obama 's strike me as even more so , \" Reich wrote on his blog . He served as the Secretary of Labor from 1993-1997 and is currently a professor at Brandeis University . \" His plans for reforming Social Security and health care have a better chance of succeeding , \" Reich continued . \" His approaches to the housing crisis and the failures of our financial markets are sounder than hers ... He has put forward the more enlightened foreign policy and the more thoughtful plan for controlling global warming . \" Reich , whose relationship with the Clintons dates back to their law school days at Yale , has long been a critic of the New York senator 's White House bid . Shortly before the Iowa caucuses in January , he wrote that voters would have a choice \" between someone who talks the talk , and somebody who 's walked the walk . \" \" I do n't get it , \" he wrote then . \" If there 's anyone in the race whose history shows unique courage and character , it 's Barack Obama . HRC 's [ Hillary Rodham Clinton 's ] campaign , by contrast , is singularly lacking in conviction about anything . \" Reich also criticized Bill Clinton earlier in the year over the former president 's sharp attacks on Obama in South Carolina . \" Bill Clinton 's ill-tempered and ill-founded attacks on Barack Obama are doing no credit to the former president , his legacy , or his wife 's campaign , \" he wrote in January . \" Nor are they helping the Democratic Party . \" Asked to respond to Reich 's endorsement , Clinton spokesman Mo Eleithee said , \" Did n't he endorse him last year ? \" Reich is the latest former Clinton administration official to announce his support for Obama . Last month , New Mexico Gov . Bill Richardson , who held several positions under Bill Clinton , also came out in support of the Illinois senator . Clinton supporter and CNN political analyst James Carville later called that an \" act of betrayal . \" Meanwhile , the Obama campaign announced that former Sens . Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Boren of Oklahoma endorsed the Illinois senator , and agreed to serve on the campaign 's national security policy team . Nunn served 25 years in the Senate and was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1987 to 1995 . He said Obama is \" our best choice to lead the nation . \" \" I believe that he will bring to the White House , high principles , clear vision and sound judgment , \" he added . Boren -- who served in the Senate from 1979 to 1994 and is the longest-serving Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -- was one of Bill Clinton 's top choices to replace Les Aspes in 1994 as U.S. Secretary of Defense . He said Obama is a person of \" sound and good judgement . \" Obama responded to the endorsements in a statement , saying the two \" will be important sources of advice and counsel for our campaign in the months ahead . \" Watch more from the campaign trail \u00bb The endorsements come just four days before Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary . At stake : 158 delegates . Also on Friday , Clinton accused Obama of \" complaining \" about Wednesday night 's debate in Pennsylvania and hinted her rival might not be equipped to handle the rigors of the Oval Office . Watch more from Wednesday 's debate \u00bb Obama said Thursday that Clinton was \" in her element \" at the debate , telling a North Carolina crowd she \" took every opportunity to get a dig in . \" \" That 's her right to kind of twist the knife in a little bit , \" he said , before adding that he understands why she 's using what he calls the tactics of the GOP . Watch more of Obama 's comments \u00bb Clinton told an interviewer Friday morning on WTXF in Philadelphia that \" being asked tough questions in a debate is nothing like the pressures you face inside the White House . \" \" When the going gets tough you ca n't run away , \" she said of Obama . Meanwhile , Obama faced more criticism Friday -- this time from Sen. John McCain . McCain 's campaign is crying foul over what it characterizes as repeated distortions from Obama .

The victims were all associated with the Town and Gown Players , a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings . \" The three people we lost ( Saturday ) were a part of the rich 50-year history of this theater and , more than that , were vital members of the Town and Gown family , \" the organization said Sunday on its Web site . The site described Bruce as \" the binding force that held the Town and Gown community together . \" \" Having worked with Town and Gown for over 20 years , at one time or another she served in every capacity at the theater , artistically and administratively , from leading lady to president of the board to chief cook and bottle washer . \" Holeman said Saturday , \" It appeared ( Zinkhan ) and his wife ( Bruce ) were having problems . \" Meanwhile , the university said that classes would be held Monday , as the school term enters its final week .

Prevention . Cure . Hope . These are words seldom associated with Alzheimer 's disease . But groundbreaking scientific research and an opportunity for powerful collaborations could lead to discovery of the ultimate cure for Alzheimer 's disease : its prevention . I know this is so because my friend Dr. Karen Hsiao Ashe , an internationally renowned Alzheimer 's disease researcher at the University of Minnesota , has developed a research road map that calls for bringing together a group of the world 's foremost laboratory and clinical investigators in the field to make prevention a reality by 2020 . This achievable goal adds \" hope \" to the vocabulary of Alzheimer 's disease and holds the promise that my children and yours will never suffer its hardship . My son , Alec , is an artist like his late grandmother . His paintings are large and uncompromising , stunning in texture , original in design . He 's got the real thing . He 's got \" it , \" just as she had . But what if he also has something else , like the APOE-e4 gene , known to increase the risk of Alzheimer 's ? What if he is in line to inherit this devastating disease ? What I could barely endure happening to my mother , I know I could not possibly endure happening to my son . So , like my friend Karen , I embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for Alzheimer 's disease . Anything short of that is too risky . Karen is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective , widely available interventions . She compares Alzheimer 's disease prevention to the polio vaccine : \" Had a vaccine not been developed for polio , hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe . Similarly , not only is treatment of Alzheimer 's likely to be less effective than prevention , it 's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive , \" she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine . Karen and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility : a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer 's . So what 's the holdup ? Well , money , of course , and attitude , perhaps . Finding a treatment within the next 10 years that will prevent Alzheimer 's disease will require a major national investment to bring together the scientists to develop an effective , safe and affordable way to block the disease . According to Harry Johns , president and CEO of the Alzheimer 's Association , \" No other disease causes so much suffering , is so certainly fatal , affects so many and drives so much cost with so little spent to overcome it . \" Why is that ?

Nujood is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago . Then , there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child , a portrait of innocence . She had a shy smile , playful nature and a whimsical giggle . Her retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting . Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World 's Untold Stories \u00bb The story was supposed to end with the divorce . There was , though , a stunning transformation . The young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph . Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world . In the fall of 2008 , Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine 's Woman of the Year , alongside some of the world 's most impressive women . She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman . There is a tell-all book , which is to be published in more than 20 languages , and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties . Nujood 's strength was celebrated by complete strangers . But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform ? \" There is no change at all since going on television , \" Nujood says bitterly . \" I hoped there was someone to help us , but we did n't find anyone . It has n't changed a thing . They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me . I wish I had never spoken to the media . \" Nujood says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off . There was never going to be a fortune . Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school , but she refuses to attend , according to Shada Nasser , the human rights lawyer who took on the child 's divorce case . \" I know Nujood was absent from the school . I spoke with her father and her family . And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school . But they said , 'You know we do n't have the money for the transportation . Do n't have the money for the food , ' \" says Nasser . She believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune . Nujood 's parents say they 've received nothing , and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way . \" I was happy I got divorced but I 'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television , \" she said , adding that she feels like an outcast even among family and friends . Nujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly . And yet , as a wife , she was spared nothing . \" I did n't want to sleep with him but he forced me to , he hit me , insulted me , \" she said .

The purported writings were a two-part manifesto . First he discussed the \" Origin of schizophrenia revealed . \" Some who know him say Garrido spoke of having schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder . In the second part of the documents , Garrido detailed his struggle with sexual urges , in writings he titled \" Stepping into the light . \" In the documents , obtained by CNN , Garrido confessed his past aggressive sexual impulses , but said he is no longer that man .

Hilary Swank plays Amelia Earhart and Richard Gere plays husband George Putnam in \" Amelia . \" The mystery we ought to be paying attention to is : What really happened on the legendary American aviator 's final , fatal flight in 1937 ? But the question audiences are left with is this : How could so tradition-busting a role model have resulted in so square , stiff , and earthbound a movie ? Why present such a modern woman in such a fusty format ? Dressed for the title role in a wardrobe of jumpsuits , leather jackets , scarves , and slinky evening wear dashing enough to stop air traffic , Hilary Swank 's Earhart does n't so much talk as make stump speeches -- even when she 's at her own breakfast table . And director Mira Nair ( \" The Namesake \" ) , working from an overexplanatory script by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan ( based on dual biographies by Susan Butler and Mary S. Lovell ) , overloads the picture with a cargo of messages , so much so that she deadens her subject 's spirit . Some of these talking points are aimed at today 's teenage girls who might admire the subject 's highly personal fashion sense ; others go out to older women who cherish her feminist cred . All of them add up to banners that might as well be flown from an aircraft tail over a beach : Amelia Earhart lived free in life and love ! And Fly ! She ! Must ! Of course , she did , setting records as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic in 1928 ( she was a passenger , but still , ladies of the day generally did n't wear leather helmets and zoom through the air ) . Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932 . She went on to launch her own brand-name fashion line . In 1935 , she became the first pilot to fly solo from Hawaii to California . Sometimes the press dubbed her Lady Lindy , linking her fame to that of pioneering pilot Charles Lindbergh . Most famously , she vanished ( along with her navigator , Fred Noonan ) in the middle of the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1937 ; her plane was never found , and she was declared legally dead in 1939 . Along the way , the celebrity married George Putnam , the publisher and tireless promoter who shaped her public image . ( Richard Gere does the honors as Putnam with all the dated , silver-head-in-hands poses required of him as a worried businessman/spouse whose wife is also his client . ) For a time , the freethinking woman also conducted a love affair with aeronautics pioneer Gene Vidal ( Ewan McGregor ) , now best known as the father of writer Gore Vidal . Swank delivers long , carefully composed explications of Earhart 's unorthodox attitude toward marriage and feminine autonomy , taken from her journal entries , in studied accents somewhere between those of the Kansas plains of Earhart 's birth and those of Katharine Hepburn in her most famous trouser-wearing , gumption-gal roles . iReport.com : Share your movie reviews \" Amelia \" dutifully conveys the salient biographical info with a trusty cinematic device : As Earhart and Noonan embark on their doomed flight , flashbacks catch the audience up on the events that got her there .

For 79 cents at the discount grocery store , he could buy a 10-pound bag of ice that would last him several days , even during the summer . Air conditioning was n't a luxury Smith had either , but fans and sea breezes kept him cool . \" Sometimes the less you have , the more you like it , \" he said . The portable lifestyle also charmed a father-son duo who set out on a yearlong European vacation . A camper van took them wherever they wanted , whenever they wanted . Spencer Pearson and his 15-year-old son , Bryce , bought a 150-square-foot van in Germany for their European excursion . Living out of the van meant \" no reservations , no packing and unpacking of suitcases , no strange beds , \" Pearson said . Modern amenities were n't amiss on the van , which included everything from the Internet and entertainment to a complete bath and kitchen , and there were occasional hotel stays and meals out that made the trip more pleasant .

Now , they are taking advantage of Hong Kong 's special administrative status that allows for a \" one country , two systems \" rule until 2047 . Hong Kong is nothing like mainland China in terms of its free flow of information , freedom of speech and multiparty political system . Those differences were recently emphasized by Google 's row with the Chinese government over censorship . In March , Google announced it was routing its users to an uncensored version of the internet search engine based in Hong Kong , amid speculation that Google would pull out of China entirely . China 's reaction to Google 's announcement \" When Google redirected its site from China to Hong Kong , it meant a lot of publicity for our free harbor , \" said David Bandurski , a China analyst at the University of Hong Kong ( HKU ) . He studies censorship issues . \" [ Google 's ] move has emphasized Hong Kong 's significance in China , benefiting from the rule of law and its potential as a free information hub . \" Many young Chinese have explored that hub since 1997 when the the British colony was handed over to China , paving the way for Chinese from the mainland to apply to universities in Hong Kong . The influx of students applying from the mainland created fierce competition to enter Hong Kong 's top universities . The number of mainland Chinese applying for HKU 's undergraduate program has increased more than tenfold in the past decade . In 2008 , some 12,000 mainlanders applied for the 300 slots that HKU reserves for students from mainland China . Li Cheng said he considers himself very lucky to be studying in Hong Kong \" Free access to information is a need and a privilege , \" he said . The influx of talent such as Li could signify a brain drain for mainland China , according to Bandurski . \" Without political reform , economic growth in China will decline , \" he said . \" Talents will leave China . Students and teachers who want to have more access to information are not dissidents anymore . They are becoming the mainstream . \" Asia 's top five universities are now located in Hong Kong , Singapore and Japan -- outstripping their rivals in mainland China -- according to a recent ranking of QS , a higher education information network company . The top mainland school was Peking University in Beijing in 12th place , down from its previous ranking of 10 . See Asian university rankings The data show that \" the tide has turned , \" according to Paul Denlinger , an internet consultant based in Hong Kong and Beijing . \" During the dotcom era [ of the 1990s ] , head-hunters were looking for talent from universities in Shanghai and Beijing , \" Denlinger said . \" Now they are coming to Hong Kong . \" With new freedom at hand , only a few fresh HKU graduates have returned to the mainland . Last year , only 3 percent of HKU graduates from mainland China returned home to look for a job . That matches the trend of Chinese students studying overseas .

It 's also about the same amount of radiation as other standard cardiac screenings , such as the nuclear stress test . There was a wide range of exposures in the study depending on the medical center and the way the tests were performed . The median radiation dose ranged from 4.6 to 30 mSv .

What 's the big deal about this meeting ? It 's a big deal because this will be only the second time that the United Nations has convened to discuss health issues . The first time was in 2001 when it addressed the HIV/AIDS crisis . Including a focus on obesity and diabetes is also significant because it is the first time that these health issues have reached this level of U.N. attention . Previously , obesity and diabetes were addressed only through WHO regional reports and conferences , most recently with the WHO 's 2004 report \" Global Strategy on Diet , Physical Activity , and Health , \" which failed to garner the attention of the entire U.N. system . The assembly meeting is also significant because , as the governing body of the World Bank and the WHO , the United Nations sends a clear message to these institutions that they need to increase their financial and technical support to combat these health threats . But will developing nations take the new U.N. resolutions seriously ? Probably not , and for several reasons . The first simply has to do with the availability of international funding for obesity and diabetes , especially when compared with HIV/AIDS . The focus on HIV/AIDS has created an international bias in favor of committing more funding for HIV/AIDS rather than obesity and diabetes . International financial support for obesity and diabetes has been minimal at best . The U.N. 's International Diabetes Federation recently stated that most bilateral and multilateral funding does not provide funding for obesity , diabetes and other related noncommunicable diseases , while only 0.9 % of the $ 22 billion spent on international health is provided for these diseases . What 's more , the assembly 's draft resolution does not make the need to raise funding for obesity , diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases a priority . Also , because the resolution says nothing about creating a new Global Fund for noncommunicable diseases , there is serious doubt that increased financial support will emerge . Second , in many developing nations , obesity and diabetes is still seen as an epidemic that mainly affects the rich . When most of the population is malnourished , politicians do not see a need to introduce new legislation for obesity and diabetes . In some nations , such as China , obesity is seen as a sign of good fortune . But ignoring the diseases will contribute to high health care costs , especially as nations strive for universal coverage and as the rich and middle classes grow . Finally , developing nations are unlikely to respond to new resolutions because there is little civil societal pressures to do so . In most nations , no proactive , well-organized civic movement has emerged in response to obesity and diabetes . While some exceptions exist , such as India 's All India Association for Advancing Research in Obesity and China 's Chinese Diabetes Society , they lack adequate funding , domestic and international support .

The opener reached 284 off only 239 balls at stumps on Thursday -- the third-highest individual score in one day 's play -- for his sixth double ton , a record for India , and is poised to become the first player to complete three triple-centuries . India , seeking a victory which would take the No . 1 Test ranking above South Africa and seal a 2-0 series victory over second-placed Sri Lanka , have already achieved a first-innings lead of 50 runs . The tourists had resumed on 366-8 with Angelo Mathews unbeaten on 86 , but the all-rounder fell one run short of his maiden Test century when he was run out by the narrowest of margins following a throw by Sachin Tendulkar . When wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni lodged the bails , replays showed that Mathews ' bat was over the line -- but not grounded -- thus he departed as ninth man out for 99 off 131 balls . Young left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha then claimed his third wicket to go with the four that his senior partner Harbhajan Singh claimed on Monday as Sri Lanka were all out for 393 , 27 minutes into the day 's play . That brought Sehwag and inexperienced opener Murali Vijay to the crease , and they launched a blistering attack on the Sri Lankan bowlers putting on 221 in just 39 overs . Vijay , playing only his second Test , was finally trapped leg before wicket by spinner Rangana Herath , having made 87 off 121 deliveries , with 10 fours and a six . The explosive Sehwag , who made 131 in India 's innings victory in Kanpur , then found another solid partner in Rahul Dravid , who calmly fed him the strike in his patient 62 off 121 balls . Sehwag passed three figures from 101 deliveries and then raced to his second century off just 67 -- the only man to pass that milestone quicker is New Zealand 's Nathan Astle , who took 153 balls against England in 2002 . \" I missed out on a double-century in the last Test in Kanpur and I wanted to make amends , \" Sehwag told reporters . \" I batted the best way I thought was possible . \" I was cautious at the start because I did not want to give the opposition any chances as I had done in the two previous matches . I thought I would bide my time , see off the new ball and then take my chances . \" Sehwag hit 40 boundaries and seven sixes , and was particularly hard on Sri Lanka 's veteran world record-holder Muttiah Muralitharan , who has struggled all series . The 37-year-old , who has taken 788 Test wickets , conceded 119 runs off his 20 overs . \" Muralitharan is a big challenge and when playing a quality bowler like him you have to attack early , otherwise he will dominate , \" Sehwag said . \" I thought rather than let him dominate , I would attack him from the start and keep him on the back foot . \" Meanwhile , Pakistan stumbled to 161-6 on a shortened first day of the second Test against New Zealand in Wellington . Daryl Tuffey celebrated his comeback after a five-year absence with two wickets as he replaced injured strike bowler Shane Bond , while captain Daniel Vettori took 3-42 with his left-arm spin as bad light ended play early . Imran Farhat and Salman Butt put on 60 for the first wicket but then fell in quick succession along with captain Mohammad Yousuf as Vettori snared two wickets in three balls .

The official was briefed on the incidents but declined to be named because she is not allowed to speak for the department . Three gang members were killed Thursday in Tamaulipas and two died early Friday in the city of Monterrey , in Nuevo Leon , the official said . One soldier was killed and four wounded in the Tamaulipas confrontation , the security official said . Two of the road blocks happened Thursday and five more were set up before dawn Friday , the official said . All were cleared within a matter of hours . The area , which borders Texas , has seen bloody fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels after a recent gangland slaying . Hours-long gun battles are common , and U.S. officials were recently forced to temporarily close the consulate in the city of Reynosa . The trouble started January 18 when a Gulf cartel member killed top Zeta lieutenant Victor Mendoza . The Zetas demanded that the Gulf cartel turn over the killer , but the narco group refused . The Zetas , composed mostly of former elite military troops , had been the armed enforcers for the Gulf cartel since 2001 . The Zetas have become more independent in recent years , and the all-out war between the two cartels indicates the split is apparently permanent . Nuevo Leon public security chief Luis Carlos Trevino was quoted in published reports as saying that the military will continue ongoing operations against the criminals despite the road blocks and other obstacles . Soldiers carried out raids Thursday in the cities of El Carmen , Sabinas , Vallecillo and Paras . \" The organized crime groups have tried through different means and methods to turn the roads of the metropolitan Monterrey area upside down , looking to form blockades with civilian vehicles to prevent support troops going to the areas where these actions are taking place , \" Trevino said at a news conference Thursday .

But Republican Scott Brown 's stunning victory in Massachusetts on Tuesday suggests Obama may not even get the first draft of health care reform through Congress , because of a huge split in his own party : Angry liberals in the House are signaling they will not rush through what they consider to be the Senate 's weak version of reform before Brown gets seated in the Senate , while skittish conservative Democrats in the Senate , like Ben Nelson of Nebraska , may no longer be on board with any kind of reform , out of a fear of becoming the next Martha Coakley . The broader problem Obama has been facing , even before Massachusetts , is that securing a mere \" starter home \" on health care or any other major issue is a far cry from the sky-high expectations he set for his supporters one year ago , when they were shouting \" Yes We Can ! \" after a campaign in which he laid out plans for dramatic change . To be fair , the president warned in his inaugural address , one year ago Wednesday , that all of the nation 's problems would not be solved so quickly . \" They are serious , and they are many , \" he said then . \" They will not be met easily or in a short span of time . \" Nevertheless , most Americans skipped past that section of the speech , and focused instead on Obama 's promise to end the bitter partisan divide in Washington on the way to shaking up the system . That goodwill from the early days evaporated quickly , and the president 's approval ratings have dipped as disappointment has grown among the very independent voters who helped elect him in 2008 . That 's why he very deliberately tried to recalibrate expectations at a Washington church this Sunday as he delivered remarks celebrating the birthday of the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. \" There was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath , \" Obama said . \" Of course , as we meet here today , one year later , we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled . Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed the seeds of its own demise , because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through the generations , because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe , we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been tested before . \" Poll : 51 percent approve of Obama after first year Channeling the outrage that fueled Brown 's upset victory in Massachusetts , House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia said the reason for the disconnect is that the president dropped the talk of unity too quickly and instead \" forged ahead with a narrow ideological agenda that has compromised his ability to create sustainable jobs and thereby fix our nation 's most pressing problems . \" In an op-ed on the new conservative Web site Daily Caller , Cantor charged his party has offered to work with the president but he has \" paid our proposals mere lip service when the cameras are on , only to rebuff our ideas in their entirety once the meeting ends . As a result , the history books may well look back on the beginning of the Obama presidency as the era of squandered opportunities . \" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs insists Republicans have not made serious overtures to meet the president halfway , perhaps hoping instead that Obama 's struggles will help the GOP in the November midterm elections . And Gibbs says the real reason for Obama 's problems stems from the fact that he made some tough decisions on unpopular -- but necessary -- government interventions to save the economy . \" Ensuring that the banks did n't collapse was not a popular decision , \" Gibbs said . \" The president strongly believes it was the right one . Ensuring that two domestic auto companies did n't go out of business -- not popular . Again , the president believed it was the right decision to make . \" Obama also frequently reminds the public that in addition to inheriting that financial crisis , he was also handed two unpopular wars , in Iraq and Afghanistan , and a continuing threat from al Qaeda , that have tested his mettle as commander in chief . All of that has weighed on Obama 's approval rating , especially the difficult decision to send more than 50,000 additional U.S. troops to escalate the war in Afghanistan . The terror incident on Christmas Day was a fresh reminder that national security is a wild card for any president . As each day in office passes , it will become harder and harder for Obama to continue pointing the finger of blame at former President George W. Bush for all of the \" inherited \" problems . And in a strange way , Tuesday 's election loss could help Obama refocus his agenda at the start of year two . A top Democratic strategist close to the White House said that it 's a lot better for the White House to take its lumps now and readjust priorities in the weeks ahead to avoid much larger losses in the midterm election -- rather than coasting along now and then getting hit with an awful surprise in November . But will Obama and his top aides dig in and refuse to move to the middle a bit ? Or will they acknowledge that Massachusetts is a wake-up call , as Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and other moderate Democrats have suggested , and make some adjustments ? Then-President Clinton was briefly humiliated by the 1994 midterm election debacle caused in large part by his overreaching health care effort , but he quickly picked himself up off the canvas and started focusing on bite-sized initiatives that won Republican support and positioned him for an easy re-election victory in 1996 . Ron Pollack , head of the liberal health group Families USA , is pushing Obama to finish off health reform quickly before Democrats lose their 60-vote supermajority in the Senate . But Pollack also said he thinks on some of the other big issues after health reform , like climate change and Wall Street regulatory reform", "1383": "John Albert Gardner III", "1384": "\" It 's a doctored tape and a set-up designed to implicate someone working as a liaison with religious and human rights groups in Russia . \"", "1385": "stopped", "1386": "early detection and treatment of mental illnesses in young women . \"", "1387": "the junta", "1388": "Eve Carson , student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "1389": "CNN ) -- Virender Sehwag plundered the second-fastest Test double hundred as India", "1390": "Belfast , Northern Ireland", "1391": "Eight", "1392": "Web-based on-demand television and movie service on Tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies", "1393": "host of the Style Network", "1394": "Monday that the United States is pressuring the \" highest levels of the Kurdish leadership \"", "1395": "two monkeys and three leopards", "1396": "destroys all our crops in the fields", "1397": "does not include already-baked Toll House cookies", "1398": "CNN ) -- Carrie McGonigle does n't want to believe that her missing daughter could be connected to a registered sex offender accused of killing a California teen", "1399": "Raptiva 's product labeling", "1400": "\" E !

Amy Bishop Anderson and her husband , Jim , were questioned after a package containing two pipe bombs was sent to the Newton , Massachusetts , home of Dr. Paul Rosenberg , a Harvard professor and a doctor at Children 's Hospital Boston , the Globe said , citing a law enforcement official . At the time , Anderson was working as a postdoctoral fellow in the hospital 's human biochemistry lab . Anderson is charged with capital murder in the Friday shooting deaths , making her eligible for the death penalty in Alabama . Authorities said she was attending a faculty meeting in a university building when she brandished a gun and shot six colleagues , killing three . The mother of four was arrested as she was leaving the building , Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes said Saturday . A 9 mm handgun was recovered from the second floor of the building after the shootings Friday . On Saturday , it was revealed that in 1986 , Anderson , then 19 , shot her brother to death in Braintree , Massachusetts . Authorities determined after an investigation that the shooting was accidental . But Braintree Police Chief Paul Frazier said Saturday , \" It is a far different story , I believe , than what was reported back then . I can not tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time . \" Anderson 's husband , Jim , told CNN on Monday that federal investigators had gathered a dozen subjects in the attempted bombing , but \" there were never any suspects . Never anyone charged , never anyone arrested . \" \" Then five years later , we got a letter from the ATF saying , 'You are in the clear , ' \" he said , referring to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . Sylvia Fluckiger , a lab technician who worked with Anderson at the time , told The Boston Globe on Sunday that Anderson had a dispute with Rosenberg shortly before the bomb incident . Fluckiger told CNN affiliate WCVB-TV in Boston , \" Police interviewed her , and she told me about it . I really wondered if she may have had , you know , some more knowledge , although I 'm not accusing her of anything . \" Rosenberg was opening a package delivered to his home while he was away on vacation , but he saw wires and a cylinder inside and called police , the Globe reported . \" She was the suspect early on , \" the law enforcement official , who the Globe said had knowledge of the case , told the newspaper of Anderson . She allegedly was concerned that she was going to receive a negative evaluation from Rosenberg , the official said . Jim Anderson told The New York Times the December 1986 death of his wife 's brother , Seth , was accidental . He declined to comment when CNN asked him about the shooting Monday . Frazier , however , said Saturday that an official involved in the case and still working for Braintree police told him that the teen had shot her brother during an argument . She fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone , then argued with her brother and shot him , he said . She fled the home after the shooting and was arrested after pointing a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an unsuccessful attempt to get the driver to stop . During the booking process , then-Chief John Polio called and told the officers to release her , Frazier said . He added her mother was then a member of the Braintree Personnel Board . Reached by CNN , Polio , now 87 and retired , denied calling in that order , saying detectives told him the shooting appeared accidental and it was determined Anderson should be released to her mother . He said any link between Anderson 's release and her mother 's position on the board was \" laughable . \" Anderson 's mother , Judith , did not answer her door Monday . Reached by telephone , she told CNN , \" We 're very distraught , \" and declined further comment . A December 8 , 1986 , article in The Boston Globe said Anderson asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12-gauge shotgun and accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon . The article cited Polio as the source . The state police report on the incident , released Sunday by the office of Rep. Bill Delahunt , D-Massachusetts , is similar to the Globe 's account . Delahunt was district attorney at the time ; staffers said he was in the Middle East on Sunday and unable to comment on the case . The 1986 report said Braintree police told state police investigators \" indications were that Amy Bishop had been attempting to manipulate the shotgun and had subsequently brought the gun downstairs in an attempt to gain assistance from her mother in disarming the weapon \" when it went off , shooting her brother in the chest . In a December 17 , 1986 , interview , Anderson told authorities she \" thought it would be a good idea if she learned how to load the shotgun in the house , \" according to the state police report . The young woman told police she was concerned for her own safety after the family home was broken into , although she previously had been afraid of the gun . She said she got the gun and loaded shells into it , but was unable to get them out .

That ability led some to consider him Iraq 's most powerful man . His political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005 .

Jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations , according to Muslim traditions . The ritual stoning of three pillars , which occurs in the tent city of Mina -- about two miles from Mecca , was the scene of stampedes and many deaths in the 1980s and 1990s as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars on the ground . But this year the Saudi government completed a new project that avoids past congestion at the site . The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $ 1.2 billion , five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones . Authorities and pilgrims say it 's a roomier atmosphere and more efficient way to accommodate the faithful . \" Everything went fine so far , \" Col. Khakled Qarar Mohammadi , head of the emergency forces at Jamarat , told CNN . \" It is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with . About 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual . So we have been preparing for this for years now . \" Irtiza Hasan , a pilgrim from the United States , said all went well at the ceremony . \" The only incident I saw was that there were some handicapped women who were turned away in fears that they get hurt . \" But Mohammadi said , \" There are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped . Each van can take up to 14 pilgrims . \" As a measure to alleviate harm , according to Muslim traditions , the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them . The five-story Jamarat bridge is air-conditioned at 19 degrees Centigrade , or 66 Fahrenheit , throughout the day and backed by water sprinklers that can reduce the temperature to about 29 degrees C , or 84 F. The bridge is designed to allow the addition of seven more levels to hold as many as 5 million pilgrims in the future if the need arises . According to authorities , the bridge is 950 meters ( 1,039 yards ) long and 80 meters ( 87 yards ) wide . Each floor is 12 meters ( 13 yards ) high with three tunnels and 12 entrances and 12 exits in six directions . It has a helicopter pad for emergencies . According to Mohammadi , the project has 509 advanced closed-circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims ' movements . Those cameras feed into the main operations room , which oversees the Jamarat Bridge and the surrounding areas -- all screened by dozens of security officers on 72 monitors at the operation room .

Gen. Eric Schoomaker , the Army Surgeon General told reporters Friday . Not surprisingly , the report showed that soldiers with multiple deployments , three or four tours of duty to Iraq or Afghanistan , had much lower morale and more mental health problems than those soldiers who have one or two combat deployments . Increased time at home , however , resulted in improved morale among troops sent back to the field . The updated survey of soldiers in Afghanistan found post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in soldiers at the same levels of the survey in 2007 , but still about double that of the 2005 survey results : 21.4 percent in 2009 , 23.4 percent for 2007 and 10.4 percent in 2005 , according to the report . In Iraq , where the survey has been done every year , lower numbers were attributed to the decrease in combat action there . The 2009 numbers showed 13.3 percent of soldiers suffering from mental health problems , compared to 18.8 percent in 2007 and 22 percent in 2006 . Army officials said that with the push of more than 20,000 additional troops into the Afghan theater of battle over the last few months , there have been fewer mental health professionals in the field to help . Army officials said the ration was about one mental health professional for every 1,120 soldiers . To combat the falling morale and lack of mental health professionals in the field , Army officials said the service needs to more than double the number of mental health providers and hopes to have at least 65 more of those providers in the field by December , making the ratio one for every 700 soldiers . The mental health assessment teams also conducted interviews with soldiers and found a drop in unit morale in Afghanistan to about half of what it was in 2007 and 2005 , when about 10 percent surveyed gave top ratings to unit morale . In 2009 , that number was 5.7 percent . The report also showed soldiers are seeing more difficulty at home with an increasing number reporting they are getting or considering getting divorced , according to the report . The overall report was based on almost 4,000 soldiers who filled out anonymous surveys in Iraq and Afghanistan between December 2008 and June 2009 . In Iraq , 2,400 soldiers were randomly selected and the results were studied by a mental health assessment team in the combat zone . About 1,500 troops in Afghanistan took the survey , Army officials said . The survey was different from previous years when all types of soldiers were surveyed together . The 2009 survey questioned combat troops and support troops separately , though Army officials said there were few differences in the results . On Friday , the Army also released its latest suicide statistics . They show an increase in the number over this time last year . The Army reported 133 suspected suicides as of October ; there were 115 as of October 2008 . Of the 133 , 90 have been confirmed , and 43 are pending confirmation , according to an Army press release . Last year the Army totaled 140 suicides in its ranks , the highest the service has recorded . \" Stigma continues to be one of the most difficult challenges we confront , \" said Brig . Gen. Colleen McGuire , the director of the Suicide Prevention Task Force for the Army . \" The more we educate our Army community about the need to get help , the need to get it early", "1451": "there were no reports of major injuries", "1452": "overdose of prescription drugs", "1453": "1864", "1454": "Ekaterina Ivanova", "1455": "a 93-foot fishing vessel that had been battling 50-knot winds and nearly 20-foot waves", "1456": "President Bush", "1457": "interview", "1458": "Jackson", "1459": "Evans", "1460": "Congress", "1461": "died in a flu epidemic", "1462": "Gaza early Tuesday as it attempted to intercept the vessel in the Mediterranean Sea , witnesses and Israeli officials said .

Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities , the captain said . But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area . Palmor said there was no response to the radio message , and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat , leading to the collision .

So the day comes and now you 've got to try to find something to wear that makes you feel halfway decent , and you have to figure out how to hold in your stomach all night and walk backward out of the room so no one sees that your butt keeps moving even when you stop .

If you 're a regular subscriber , you 'll notice you 've not seen a head-to-toe shot all year . Why ? Because I did n't want to be seen. \" In 1992 I reached my heaviest , 237 pounds . I was 38 . Then , four years ago , I made it a goal to lose weight , and I appeared on the January 2005 cover at a toned 160 pounds . I thought I was finished with the weight battle . I was done . I 'd conquered it . I was so sure , I was even cocky . I had the nerve to say to friends who were struggling , \" All you have to do is work out harder and eat less ! Get your 10,000 steps in ! None of that starchy stuff ! \" Bam ! Karma is a bear of a thing . So here I stand , 40 pounds heavier than I was in 2006 . ( Yes , you 're adding correctly ; that means the dreaded 2-0-0 . ) I 'm mad at myself . I 'm embarrassed . I ca n't believe that after all these years , all the things I know how to do , I 'm still talking about my weight . I look at my thinner self and think , \" How did I let this happen again ? \" Oprah.com : How to prevent weight gain relapse It happened slowly . In February 2007 , at 53 , I started to have some health issues . At first I was unable to sleep for days . My legs started swelling . My weight started creeping up , first 5 pounds , then 10 pounds . I was lethargic and irritable . My internal clock seemed totally out of whack . I began having rushing heart palpitations every time I worked out . Okay , I 've never loved daily exercise , but this was different . I actually developed a fear of working out . I was scared that I would pass out . Or worse . I felt as if I did n't know my own body anymore . After many trips to various doctors , I received a diagnosis . I had hyperthyroidism ( an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course did n't make me lose a single pound ) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism ( a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain ) . My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must \" learn to embrace hunger \" or I would immediately gain weight . Believe me , no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger . It seemed as if the struggle I 'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over . I felt completely defeated . I thought , \" I give up . I give up . Fat wins . \" All these years I 'd had only myself to blame for lack of willpower . Now I had an official , documented excuse . The thyroid diagnosis felt like some kind of prison sentence . I was so frustrated that I started eating whatever I wanted -- and that 's never good . My drug of choice is food . I use food for the same reasons an addict uses drugs : to comfort , to soothe , to ease stress . I switched doctors and still gained weight . At one point I was on three medications : one for heart palpitations , another for high blood pressure , another to moderate my thyroid . Who knew this tiny butterfly gland at the base of the throat had so much power ? When it 's off , your whole body feels the effects . I followed my doctor 's orders to the letter ( except for the part about working out ) . I took the prescribed medication religiously at the same time each day . Oprah.com : The truth about your thyroid Being medicated , though necessary , made me feel as if I were viewing life through a veil . I felt like an invalid . Everything was duller . I felt like the volume on life got turned down . I realized this to some extent , but I was n't fully aware of the effect of the medication until I had a conversation with my friend Bob Greene . He 'd given up lecturing me about working out and eating well , but we were walking together one day and he said , \" I think something 's wrong . You 're listless . Your movements are slower , even when you 're just doing normal stuff . Twice I 've told you something and you do n't remember it . There 's no sparkle in your eyes . I think you 're in some sort of depression . \" Greene talks about Oprah 's struggle \u00bb Me -- depressed ? I had n't thought I was , but definitely something was off . I felt like the life force was being sucked out of me . I always had an excuse for being tired . It took extra effort to do everything . I did n't want to go anywhere , and I did n't want to be seen any more than I had to . I could oversee a show and a magazine that tell people how to live their best lives , but I definitely was n't setting an example . I was talking the talk , but I was n't walking the walk . And that was very disappointing to me . Immediately after that conversation with Bob , I called my doctor . \" All this medicine is making my life feel like a flat line , \" I said . So my doctor slowly weaned me off it , except for one aspirin a day . ( By the way , never suddenly stop taking prescribed medication , especially heart and blood pressure medication , without checking with your physician . ) That choice was the beginning of my road back to health -- and back to myself .

Nightlife on the island is likely to mean a moonlit walk on the beach rather than a drink at the bar , and the odds are good the locals will sport gray hair . Elegant setting Buffered by Sarasota Bay on one side and facing the Gulf of Mexico on the other , the Key is sheltered from the tourist hustle and bustle of mainland Florida . At less than 11 miles in length and no more than a mile across in its widest places , LBK also feels like a secluded community with an elegant flavor of its own . The surroundings are lush , upscale and serene . A trip down Gulf of Mexico Drive , the island 's main artery , reveals golf courses , condominiums and homes ranging from newly constructed mansions to older , one-story houses . The traffic is light , life moves at a slower pace and the mood is relaxed . \" You wo n't find mini-malls , towering billboards , or glaring neon signs , \" the local Chamber of Commerce promises . Nonhuman island visitors also contribute to the mellow atmosphere . Dolphins regularly swim just offshore . Great egrets and great blue herons fish along the beach , while pelicans dive into the water in search of a meal . Birds of all sizes regularly patrol the palm-lined parking lot of the local supermarket looking for scraps of food from the lunch crowd . Wingless creatures also pop up in unexpected places . Visitors walking into one establishment are greeted by a stern voice exclaiming , \" Bear , no ! \" Bear , it turns out , is a curious 5-month old Chesapeake Bay retriever who insists on checking out all the customers entering the store despite his owner 's orders to stay put . Lodging and shopping There are few hotels on Longboat Key , but rental homes and condos abound , so it 's best to make lodging arrangements in advance , especially for visitors who plan to stay a while . Low season generally starts in May and runs until November .

( Full story ) Reporters for international news outlets , including CNN , could talk about the rallies in their live reports but were not allowed to leave their hotel rooms and offices .

Also Tuesday , Iran 's powerful Guardian Council announced a partial vote recount , an apparent U-turn after the country 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed ultraconservative Ahmadinejad 's win . The Guardian Council met with the three opposition candidates -- Moussavi , Mehdi Karrubi and Mohsen Rezaie -- and asked them to specify the areas where they wanted a recount , a council spokesman told the official Islamic Republic News Agency . Watch how the decision may not satisfy the opposition \u00bb Moussavi rejected the recount , according to an official close to his camp , demanding fresh elections and accusing the country 's religious elite of trying to further manipulate the outcome of the original vote . An official close to the opposition leader 's camp , speaking on condition of anonymity , said a recount would provide another opportunity for the government to manipulate the results . He said the council ordered the printing of 53 million ballots for the elections , but only 39 million were used . Fourteen million ballots were missing . Khamenei appealed to Iranians on Tuesday to stand behind the Islamic republic . \" Some people are against the unity of the Iranian nation and the solidarity of the Islamic system , \" Khamenei said in a meeting with representatives of the four presidential candidates , government-funded Press TV reported . \" Such acts and vandalism and some crimes that were committed are not related to the candidates ' supporters but to disturbers of peace and all should stand against them , \" Khamenei said . A former Iranian parliamentary speaker , addressing Tuesday 's pro-Ahmadinejad rally , called on Moussavi to accept defeat . Gholam Ali Haddad Adel urged Moussavi to \" take the leaders ' advice \" so that \" everyone will benefit \" \" I want to remind my brother Mr. Moussavi that we do know that the leadership of the revolution likes you and he has advised you if you have any complaints please refer to the Council of Guardians , \" Adel said . Iranian security forces arrested three reformist politicians Tuesday for their alleged involvement in orchestrating post-election violence , Press TV reported . Mohammed Ali Abtahi , an adviser to presidential candidate and former parliament speaker Mehdi Karrubi , was one of the three detained . Abtahi was also Iran 's vice president under reformist President Mohammed Khatami . The other two were identified as Behzad Nabavi and Saeed Hajjarian . Ahmadinejad 's resounding election win surprised many experts who had expected Moussavi to win or put up a much stronger fight . Moussavi , a former prime minister thought of as a reformist , enjoys tremendous support among youth , who make up almost 60 percent of Iran 's population of 70 million . He tapped into their dissatisfaction with the faltering economy under Ahmadinejad and with an unemployment rate that tops 30 percent by some accounts , analysts said .

The Army IG is already in the middle of an investigation ordered by the previous secretary of the Army to review management of the cemetery . In recent years , the cemetery -- where President Kennedy and thousands of fallen U.S. soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines are buried -- has had a number of embarrassing problems . In 2008 , the cemetery discovered that workers inadvertently buried cremated remains at a grave site already in use . Those remains were moved to another grave site . In 2003 , as workers were digging a grave for a new burial , they discovered a casket already buried there . There was no headstone or grave marker to indicate who . Only recently , after a report by a journalist at Salon.com , did the Army take action on the problem . Over the summer , the cemetery put up a headstone on the mystery grave that reads \" Unknown . \" As McHugh ordered the new investigation , the Army released results of a separate investigation of problems at the cemetery . That investigation focused on the discovery of the \" Unknown \" grave . A spokesman for the Military District of Washington , which conducted the review , said \" Cemetery records , the MDW investigation , and the non-invasive geophysical analysis of the grave sites strongly indicate that a husband and wife , who died years apart and should have been buried in the same grave site , were instead buried in adjacent graves . \" A DNA test of the remains in the two adjacent graves could prove conclusively that is what happened , but the family of the husband and wife did not wish for their remains to be disturbed . The MDW said the Army will abide by the family 's wishes and has ordered a headstone to properly mark the wife 's grave . One of the problems discovered by the MDW investigation was a possible lack of adequate staffing at the cemetery . Last year Arlington conducted 4,377 burials , up more than 21 percent over the past 10 years . During that same period the number of civilian staff members has dropped nearly 19 percent . Currently the cemetery has four employees to schedule 135 to 150 funerals a week as well as maintain all grave records . Arlington , which sits on a hill across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial , has been the final resting place for America 's military heroes since the Civil War , when the Union seized the estate from the family of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee .

Most of the food in an MRE can be eaten straight from the plastic vacuum-packed pouch . But if water is added to a chemical heater , a hot meal results . Each pallet was rigged with a large parachute as well as special corrugated cardboard padding that would minimize damage to the water and food when the load hit the ground . One of the supervisors on the rigging crew at the Army 's Fort Bragg , which is adjacent to Pope Air Force Base , said they wanted to make sure as much of the aid , especially the water , survived the airdrop , but they predicted as many as 1-in-10 of the bottles would break on impact .

The first time was in 2001 when it addressed the HIV/AIDS crisis . Including a focus on obesity and diabetes is also significant because it is the first time that these health issues have reached this level of U.N. attention . Previously , obesity and diabetes were addressed only through WHO regional reports and conferences , most recently with the WHO 's 2004 report \" Global Strategy on Diet , Physical Activity , and Health , \" which failed to garner the attention of the entire U.N. system . The assembly meeting is also significant because , as the governing body of the World Bank and the WHO , the United Nations sends a clear message to these institutions that they need to increase their financial and technical support to combat these health threats . But will developing nations take the new U.N. resolutions seriously ? Probably not , and for several reasons . The first simply has to do with the availability of international funding for obesity and diabetes , especially when compared with HIV/AIDS . The focus on HIV/AIDS has created an international bias in favor of committing more funding for HIV/AIDS rather than obesity and diabetes .

Once fully trained , he will assist federal and local police officers as well as private corporations in nosing out deadly explosives at schools , airports and public events . His detective skills can potentially save thousands of lives in an era where law enforcement agencies are aggressively fighting against drugs and terrorist attacks . \" Think about a scenario like the 1996 Olympic bombings , \" says Kaden 's trainer Jeff Schettler , a cheery man who has coached hundreds of dogs to sniff out bombs , drugs , missing people and corpses since the mid-1990s . Demand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement . The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S . The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . Watch three detection puppies in action \u00bb Official records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S . In more recent years , police departments realized a dog 's nose was a valuable asset . Dogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others . For each drop of odor detected by a dog , the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000 drops of odor , veterinarians say . Can your pooch be a detection dog ? \u00bb Other animals may have smelling skills that rival a dog 's , such as pigs nosing for truffles in France or honey bees that can sniff out TNT particles , but veterinarians say dogs are the most controllable and sociable for their human handlers . Police dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection , police officers say . Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats . They can find children who have mysteriously vanished overnight . Detection dogs can even weed out pest-infested apples and oranges accidentally left in suitcases at airports . \" They are a growing aspect of law enforcement , \" says Jim Watson , secretary at the North American Police Work Dog Association and a handler for decades . Earlier this month , investigators were baffled during the international manhunt for George Zinkhan , a former University of Georgia professor accused of fatally shooting his wife and two other people . Two weeks into the search , two cadaver dogs , a German shepherd named Circe and an Australian shepherd named Madison , arrived . Within 10 hours , the dogs picked up the scent of Zinkhan 's remains in a shallow pit hidden in a thick forest . Once the dogs neared the suspect 's body , they gave their handlers personalized signals . Circe barked excitedly . Madison lay down . Trainer Jeff Schettler explains Kaden is an unlikely candidate for police work . Basenjis , a breed that originated in central Africa , are usually used as hunting or show dogs . There are only two other trained police dog basenjis recorded by the North American Police Work Dog Association . Most trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs , preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record . Most law enforcement agencies rely on Belgian Malinoises and German shepherds for detection work because of their protective yet friendly personalities , but labs , bloodhounds and beagles also can be used . \" We 're not trying to fix anything , \" Schettler says . \" We 're trying to enhance it . \" Schettler points out some of Kaden 's advantages : The dog 's weight will peak at about 25 pounds", "2004": "60", "2005": "18-year-old", "2006": "Her sister , the No . 6 seed Venus , fought off a challenge on Monday from Italy 's Francesca Schiavone", "2007": "Miami-bound bus from Philadelphia", "2008": "since the rise of al Qaeda", "2009": "US Airways Flight 1549 remained in the icy Hudson River on Saturday .

They are versions of our best selves : the doers in life , the fearless , those who go over the mountain and come back to tell us what 's on the other side . While we may think the true adventurers are a species apart , we are all adventurers at heart -- yet sometimes the urge is stifled by modern life . The lust for adventure is planted in childhood . How many of us sat enthralled under the blankets as our parents read us the adventures of the Famous Five , \" Treasure Island , \" \" Where the Wild Things Are , \" \" The Swiss Family Robinson , \" \" Tarzan \" and \" Peter Pan \" ? Children weaned on such stories may be forgiven for assuming adulthood is one long adventure that swings wildly between jungles , swamps , deserted islands and alpine heights . Yet modern life is increasingly sedentary and safety-conscious . The desire for comfort and convenience ameliorates our contradictory urge to explore . A few have it thrust upon them : stranded in an inhospitable place , lost in a jungle or called up for combat -- and they find themselves dropped in an adventure that they may not have chosen ; but for the main part , adventure comes to those who seek it . Dr. James Thompson , a senior lecturer in psychology at University College London , says seeking adventure is more common \" amongst people who are extroverted , who are outgoing , who are sociable , because one of the things they need -- apart from the excitement of people -- is excitement generally . \" But if you think adventure is something that only happens to other people ; that you are too unfit to climb a mountain , too scared to sail across the open sea , too nervous to travel through a country where you ca n't speak the language ; perhaps you should rethink . After all , having an adventure could be good for you . Psychologists have linked adventure-seeking with a range of positive qualities . Adventure can : Following the stories of this age 's greatest adventurers such as polar explorer Douglas Mawson , Everest climber Edmund Hillary and mountaineer Reinhold Messner , we are encouraged not just to follow their paths up mountains or along rock faces -- they also inspire us to take more risks , to seize more from each day . Who could fail to be inspired after watching CNN interview the world 's greatest living mountaineer , Reinhold Messner ? In 1980 , Messner was the first person to ascend Mount Everest alone without supplementary oxygen . Later , he crossed Antarctica on skis . He tells CNN anchor Becky Anderson : \" I 'm a normal person , a totally normal person , and I was really lucky in my life to have to have the opportunity to follow my dreams . So in the beginning I was a rock climber , and all my enthusiasm , my energy and my willpower went into rock climbing . \" Many young people are naturally adventurous -- throwing their energy and enthusiasm behind sport , hobbies and travel . Witness the explosion of school leavers taking gap years ( a year off in between school and university or the workforce ) , with the destinations becoming more and more exotic and activities accompanying the travel designed to expand their mind as well as their horizons . But later in life , we can wake up and find our lives leeched of adventure . We may be loaded down with a mortgage , kids or a demanding job . Adventure then becomes something we prefer to read about rather than live . We fall into the trap of the armchair traveler and become transfixed by all the journeys we did n't make . Instead of setting out on our own expeditions , we read Joe Simpson 's account of his near-death mountaineering experiences in \" Touching the Void . \" Or we follow Sebastian Junger 's account of wild sea adventures in \" The Perfect Storm . \" But while we are great armchair adventurers , a craving for the real thing can stir in us when we feel the need to change and shake things up . Women in their 40s are leading the charge towards adventure . A survey released by the Adventure Travel Trade Association in March 2007 said today 's typical adventure traveler was \" female and fortyish . \" \" Women make up the majority of adventure travelers ( 52 percent ) worldwide , with the most common destination being South America , \" said the trade association . The survey of travelers from 35 countries also found that people aged 41 to 60 are the highest participating age group in adventure travel . A survey by YouGov in the UK has identified a new subset of British -- the Nifty Fifties . They 've had the responsible jobs and raised their children -- and now they want adventure . Tesco Life Insurance has noticed : \" They 've decided to take the five star version of the student gap year , encompassing all of the adventure with none of the discomforts .

The rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration 's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries . The report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border , including Balochistan , the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law . It also notes the government 's inability to get a handle on the extremists . Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces , it says , \" the government of Pakistan 's authority in the area continued to be challenged . \" Ronald Schlicher , the State Department 's acting coordinator of counterterrorism , told reporters the Obama administration has \" real concerns \" that al Qaeda 's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States . \" We have a real sense that it 's happening , but we have imperfect knowledge of what they 're doing , \" he said . Pakistan 's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari . The deal , criticized by the United States , allowed the Taliban to implement Islamic law , or sharia , in the region in exchange for an end to fighting . The recent operations are part of the Pakistani army 's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions . The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan . As a result , the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan . The strikes have rankled relations between the two countries . Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters , communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country 's counterterrorism efforts . President Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is \" gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan . \" Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office , Obama said the United States has \" huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable \" and does n't end up a \" nuclear-armed militant state . \" After making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks , Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , is \" very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships ' inability to confront that threat , \" according to his chief spokesman . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have called Taliban gains in Pakistan an \" existential threat \" to the country . The State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India , in November , attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary , amaat ud-Dawa . Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups ' camps and made several arrests , the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan . The report says Afghanistan is plagued by \" an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks , \" despite the efforts of NATO forces and the Afghan government . \" The anti-government insurgency remained a capable , determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority , \" the report warns . Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses , the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers \" remained undiminished . \" \" Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated , \" it says . \" Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan , along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking , have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities . \" Iran is also a source of training to the Taliban \" on small-unit tactics , small arms , explosives and indirect-fire weapons , \" the report says . \" Since at least 2006 , Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition , rocket-propelled grenades , mortar rounds , 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members , \" it says . While terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year , \" there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country , including a decrease in civilian casualties , enemy attacks , and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year , \" the report says .

Hong Kong is nothing like mainland China in terms of its free flow of information , freedom of speech and multiparty political system . Those differences were recently emphasized by Google 's row with the Chinese government over censorship . In March , Google announced it was routing its users to an uncensored version of the internet search engine based in Hong Kong , amid speculation that Google would pull out of China entirely . China 's reaction to Google 's announcement \" When Google redirected its site from China to Hong Kong , it meant a lot of publicity for our free harbor , \" said David Bandurski , a China analyst at the University of Hong Kong ( HKU ) . He studies censorship issues . \" [ Google 's ] move has emphasized Hong Kong 's significance in China , benefiting from the rule of law and its potential as a free information hub . \" Many young Chinese have explored that hub since 1997 when the the British colony was handed over to China , paving the way for Chinese from the mainland to apply to universities in Hong Kong . The influx of students applying from the mainland created fierce competition to enter Hong Kong 's top universities . The number of mainland Chinese applying for HKU 's undergraduate program has increased more than tenfold in the past decade . In 2008 , some 12,000 mainlanders applied for the 300 slots that HKU reserves for students from mainland China . Li Cheng said he considers himself very lucky to be studying in Hong Kong \" Free access to information is a need and a privilege , \" he said .

In the arts , \" Olive Kitteridge \" by Elizabeth Strout won for fiction , \" Slavery by Another Name : The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II \" by Douglas A. Blackmon won in the general nonfiction category , and \" American Lion : Andrew Jackson in the White House \" by Jon Meacham won for the category of biography . Among the winners in journalism categories were the Las Vegas ( Nevada ) Sun for public service , the San Diego ( California ) Union-Tribune 's Steve Breen for editorial cartooning and columnist Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post for commentary . For the first time , all 14 Pulitzer journalism categories were open for competition from news organizations that publish only on the Internet . Entirely online entries were previously permitted in only two categories : breaking news coverage and breaking news photography Since 2006 , online content from newspaper Web sites had been permitted in all Pulitzer journalism categories , but online-only newspapers were not allowed to submit entries . Despite the opportunity , there were no winners from online only news sites . Web sites for print magazines and broadcast outlets are not eligible to enter , said Sig Gissler , administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes . Amy Mitchell , deputy director for the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , said that allowing online-only publications to apply for the prestigious award is recognition of the growing importance of online media . \" Much of [ media ] comes from traditional press , but a lot is coming from non-traditional press as well , and that needs to be recognized along with what 's being produced in traditional media , \" she said . \" We 've clearly hit a point now where we 've seen the audience migration to the Web accelerate . \" Mitchell said a survey of online journalists conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism found some concerns about the possibility of online reporting changing the fundamental values of journalism . Those surveyed cited issues like a focus on speed and loss of accuracy as possible issues that could arise with journalism on the Web . But with those concerns , Mitchell said , comes the opportunity to tell stories in a multidimensional way . \" We see some tremendous reporting that could not exist in former modes of communication , \" she said , observing that media platforms such as text , photo galleries and video can not only be connected but be used to connect journalists to Internet users and Internet users to each other . \" Those are tremendous changes , \" she said . Robert M. Steele , the Eugene S. Pulliam Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism at DePauw University in Indiana , said the core values of accuracy and fairness have to be honored , no matter the method of reporting . Still , Steele said , further opening the Pulitzer Prizes to online publications \" gives further weight to the role that digital journalism plays in this era . \" \" In some ways , it 's increased legitimacy for new forms of delivering journalism , \" Steele said . \" It also heightens the discussion about the distinction between basic information and substantive journalism . Just because somebody throws something online does n't mean it is journalism . \" David Plotz , editor of Slate , said his site did not apply for the Pulitzers despite what he believes was his publication 's exceptional political , technology and business coverage . \" We are not a hard-news site , and we do n't do the kinds of stories and projects that have traditionally been awarded , \" Plotz said . Plotz said the recognition for online journalism is more than warranted . \" It 's an overdue acknowledgement that some of the best journalism in the world and in America is being created not for print publication but for places that live entirely on the Web , \" he said . \" There 's so much of it that does n't ever get into a print publication and yet is as important to shaping the debate and to changing how people think about things as to anything you might read in one of our great newspapers or magazines . \" Pulitzer Prizes for journalism were also awarded to the following : Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart of the Los Angeles", "2343": "March 17 , 2009", "2344": "Phil O'Donnell", "2345": "19", "2346": "Rio de Janeiro , Brazil", "2347": "Wednesday", "2348": "Apple", "2349": "Michael Landon", "2350": "smaller digs", "2351": "1984", "2352": "2.5 million", "2353": "green-jobs handyman", "2354": "Democrats by a 2-to-1 margin", "2355": "Jane Goodall", "2356": "", "2357": "$ 37,500 Thursday afternoon", "2358": "pictures of their \" four- and sometimes three-legged friends at home", "2359": "the practices , a top congressman says", "2360": "India voiced strong objections to the auction .

Both men say their experiences were so commonplace among their generation that none were able to talk about it until 40 years later . Rosier told me that what he and the veterans discuss among themselves is very different to what is said in television interviews ; but when pushed , he describes what it 's like to kill another man . \" We could never get our fathers to talk about the first World War , because they were involved in close combat . And twice in the second World War it happened to me . \" I came face to face with a German , and I beat him to the draw . I killed him .

Now , out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine . There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before . But even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public , is coming out still a big deal ? To shed light on the issue , CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt , 45 , about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood . CNN : Has being openly gay affected your career ? Batt : I came from the stage ; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage . Being gay never really posed a problem . In the Broadway community , it 's always been a little more accepted . There 's something different with film acting and TV acting . You 're in someone 's home -- it 's more intimate . When I look at someone , I really do n't care about whom they 're sleeping with or what they 're doing . I 'm thinking they either have talent or no talent . But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people 's private lives . It 's still like high school . Batt plays both straight , gay roles \u00bb CNN : When did you come out ? Batt : My real Broadway break was in \" Starlight Express . \" At that time , I was toying with [ coming out ] . It 's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be . I 've heard of people doing it in Hollywood . It 's a very sad and difficult choice . I think it 's a personal journey , and I think people on their own time will figure it out . Clay Aiken is still really very , very young ; he has to deal with his own issues . Thank God , when it was my time , no one was pushing me ; no one was trying to force me . It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother . It went wonderfully . My mother said , \" No matter what , you 're my son . I 'm going to love you . \" Not one of my family or friends turned their back on me . I was fortunate , but it was still a very difficult thing to do , and I was fearful . Afterwards , it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back ; all those years worrying for nothing . But not everyone is as lucky ; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families , which is criminal . Just this year , I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation , a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and can not afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization . I only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \" Jeffrey , \" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy . I said to myself , if I get this , I 've just got to sit down and talk with my family . My partner and I have been together 19 years , and that was the same time he told his parents . A good parent knows ; they love and accept . What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society .

With parts of his capital ablaze , Mubarak said he was asking his government to resign and would soon announce a new one , pledging to address the concerns of thousand of Egyptians protesting in Cairo 's streets . \" I just spoke to him after his speech , \" Obama said , \" and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise . Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people . Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away . \" This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise , \" Obama said . The U.S. president repeated his administration 's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged \" concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people . \" Obama 's remarks , delivered from State Dining Room , were the strongest yet from the United States . \" There must be reform , \" he said , \" political , social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people . \" In the absence of these reforms , \" he said , \" grievances have built up over time . \" The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just , more free and more hopeful , \" he concluded . In his remarks , Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding . And privately , U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending . A senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak 's address as \" hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing , but what did you expect ? \" It 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out , \" and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption . \" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said . Before the speech , senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts , worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying . Mubarak , they said , has two choices : to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown . The United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly , the senior officials said , because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality , causing a further crackdown . The officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration , including with U.S . Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey , who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day . A senior State Department official said , \" our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform . \" \" We 'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are , but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech , \" said the official , who could n't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation . Earlier , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \" very concerned \" about the situation in Egypt , adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States . \" This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt , \" Gibbs said . \" We are watching very closely the actions of the government , the police and all of those in the military . \" The United States will review its \" assistance posture \" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days , he said . Gibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage , including at the offices of Egypt 's ruling party . That building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday , Nile TV reported . A CNN witness saw the building ablaze . Gibbs said the collective consequences of the government 's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt . \" Within that review is military \" assistance , Gibbs said . Egypt receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year , second only to Israel , and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to State Department figures . \" The die is cast , \" said Leslie H. Gelb , the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations . \" The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators . \" Gibbs said , \" we 've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms \" but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests . \" We do n't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together , \" Gelb said , cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government . Often considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East , Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal , a strategic passageway for trade across the region . Earlier Friday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt 's government \" to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications . \" \" We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters , and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces , \" Clinton said Friday , referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces . \" At the same time , protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully , \" she said . \" As a partner , we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately , \" Clinton said . \" They need to view civil society as their partner , not a threat . \" Servers of Egypt 's main internet provider were down early Friday , including servers for the Egyptian government 's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo . Early Friday , Gibbs said that he is \" very concerned about violence in Egypt , \" tweeting that the \" government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet . \" But at least one internet service provider , Noor , was still working . The U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to \" defer non-essential travel to Egypt . \" \" U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes , \" the agency added in a written travel alert . The agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage . \" U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times , \" the statement said , urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone . Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier 's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday , and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest . President Barack Obama has requested \" multiple briefings \" on Egypt , White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday . He has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the target of the protesters ' anger , \" but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed , \" Vietor said . Former Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak \" without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States . \" \" I think that , if anything , one might ask why has n't President Mubarak called President Obama and said , 'Are you with me or against me ? ' I mean , that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration , \" Cohen said . Obama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued . \" It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances , \" he said this week .

Abed is the suspected planner behind the 2004 killing , burning and mutilation of four American contractors in Fallujah , Iraq . Abed complained to investigators that the SEALs punched him during his detention . There were arraigned in military court on charges of giving false statements to investigators and abusing Abed . In January , a judge ruled that Keefe and Huertas will have their cases heard in Iraq next month . Petty Officer 2nd Class McCabe , 24 , faces a special court martial on May 3 at the naval base in Norfolk , Virginia . The case against the Navy SEALs sparked outrage that the sailors are being tried at all for handling a suspect in the contractors ' murders , one of the most notorious incidents in the war . The killings got widespread news coverage when the burned bodies of two of the contractors were paraded through the streets of Fallujah and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered . At today 's news conference , Burton and Rohrabacher will present signed petitions of support from more than 100,000 Americans calling for the SEALs ' exoneration .

Kennedy went public Sunday about Tobin 's request , originally made in a private letter to Kennedy in 2007 .

The issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men . A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language , with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House . Kennedy , a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history , is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy , the nation 's first Catholic president . When running for president in 1960 , John Kennedy famously said he was \" not the Catholic candidate for president , \" but \" the Democratic Party 's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic . \" Edward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies , including support for a woman 's right to choose an abortion .

The court issued the warrant in March on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to his five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan 's Darfur region . \" The evidence shows it is genocide , \" Moreno-Ocampo said . The warrant was the first one ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world 's only permanent war crimes tribunal , based at The Hague in the Netherlands . It includes five counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , forcible transfer , torture and rape . It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging . Al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued , even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague , the court says . The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur , and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes . Sudan denies the death toll is that high . The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government . To counter the rebels , Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur , killing , torturing and raping residents there , according to the United Nations , Western governments and human rights organizations . The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength . In his appeal to the court Monday , Moreno-Ocampo complained that the judges ' standard for adding the genocide charge to the warrant is too high . The judges want him to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that al-Bashir committed genocide , but that level of proof is not required for a warrant , which only requires a reasonable inference of guilt , he said . \" They are requesting a level of evidence that is the level of evidence required at the trial stage , not at the beginning of the process , \" Moreno-Ocampo said . Part of the reason that prosecutors can not provide more evidence at this stage is because al-Bashir is attacking witnesses who are willing to provide information to prosecutors , Moreno-Ocampo said . Presenting more evidence could endanger the victims , he said . \" It 's a legal issue , \" he said . \" The judgment by itself is very important , but in addition I can not accept this wrong legal standard . \" The judges believe the crimes that Moreno-Ocampo classifies as genocide instead fall under the category of crimes against humanity , he said .

In guidelines published on its Web site , the FDA said it has \" some concern \" about the safety of BPA , and supports efforts by industry to remove BPA from infant bottles and feeding cups . Dr. Josh Sharfstein , deputy FDA commissioner , said the agency is trying to determine whether it has the legal authority to quickly force such products off the market if manufacturers do n't do it voluntarily . According to Sharfstein , the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to BPA . Bisphenol-A is found in many products , but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula , and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys . A handful of states and cities including Minnesota , Connecticut , Massachusetts and Chicago , Illinois , have passed laws in some form banning BPA in products meant for children . The new position is a partial reversal of the FDA 's declaration in 2008 that BPA has no adverse effects . That announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry-funded research . Since then , the agency says on its Web site , \" recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals . While BPA is not proven to harm children or adults , these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of BPA . \" The new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program , which in its own 2008 report said there is \" some concern \" for BPA 's effects on the brain , behavior and prostate gland , in developing fetuses , infants and children . Other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease , but the authors of those studies say it 's not clear the problems were actually caused by BPA . At a news conference Friday , FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said further research is needed \" to determine if and when further action is needed . \" The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has been allotted $ 30 million to study the health effects of BPA . Hamburg said that research would likely be complete in 18 to 24 months . In a separate review , the Environmental Protection Agency is weighing whether to list BPA as a chemical of concern under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act", "3157": "Leonardo da Vinci", "3158": "Prospero Nograles said Sunday , according to the Philippine News Agency", "3159": "11 girls in the United States , ages 3 to 13", "3160": "\" everybody just hates me . \"", "3161": "nearby clinic", "3162": "Shanghai", "3163": "Ghana 's Parliament on Saturday", "3164": "angrily opposed the proposal", "3165": "life imprisonment", "3166": "Houston , Texas", "3167": "\" sexting \" infractions", "3168": "Jim Smith", "3169": "severe health", "3170": "March 10 .

Being driven to Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow , the long goodbyes with my family and friends . I remember the faces of my crying mother , my puzzled father . They were afraid of what would happen to their son and their grandson in a strange land . As we were leaving , I had to brace myself for the possibility that I would not see my family again . After all , the Iron Curtain , although rusty and crumbling , was still around . The unknown lay ahead , and it was scary . Thirty-three years in the Soviet Union were over . I felt like our lives were about to start anew . For us , life in Moscow was actually not bad at all . Family and numerous friends always compensated for living behind the Iron Curtain and numerous day-to-day shortcomings . My generation grew up in a culture of near-deprivation , constant shortages of everything imaginable . But that was nothing compared with the lives of my parents and especially my grandparents ' . I recall how people used to stock up on everything . Everyone 's refrigerators were actually packed with food . And , as I said , we made it through with the support of friends and family . But since my early childhood , I had heard about the \" Zapad \" -- the West , in Russian . And the older I grew , the more attractive Zapad seemed .

When we came to Atlanta , we were surprised . Everyone was driving cars , and there were no sidewalks to walk on . Once , when we walked on a street looking for an apartment to rent , a friend from CNN pulled up and offered us a ride . He ended up driving us around for the rest of the day . A lot has changed since then . I have been working for CNN since 1992 . My son is a young man who lives in New York City , where he works in book publishing . My wife is an IT specialist whose long working hours are hard to be envious of . Last year , I was diagnosed with a brain tumor . I had to undergo surgery and have been monitored and given treatment since . But , for now at least , I like to consider myself healthy .

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says signs of optimism for a global economic recovery can be seen . The move comes in the wake of a major push by President Obama , the officials said . The G-20 will now essentially eclipse the G-8 , which will continue to meet on major security issues but carry much less influence . \" It 's a reflection of the world economy today and the players that make it up , \" said one senior official . Nations like China , Brazil and India -- which were locked out of the more elite G-8 -- will be part of the larger group .

The gathering is Obama 's first time hosting a major international summit . \" We 're meeting at a time where , for the first time since London , certainly for the first time in a year , we 're seeing the first signs of optimism about prospects for global recovery , \" U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters Thursday . \" I think the broad consensus of private economists and businesses are that we 're beginning to see growth in the United States , and around the world we see exports rising and forecasts for growth are being revised upwards . \" \" This is encouraging , \" he said , \" but we have a ways to go . \" He said the leaders are \" going to keep working to sustain the progress we 've seen . And I can say with confidence , based on my discussions with finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world , there is a common , shared commitment to make sure we 're working together to sustain these early signs of recovery and growth . \" One of the key goals is preventing such a crisis from occurring in the future , he said . \" In the run-up to this crisis , many of the world 's largest economies depended on the American consumer to buy their exports to drive growth , and we made it easy ; for too long , Americans were buying too much and saving too little , \" Geithner said . \" And that 's no longer an option for us or for the rest of the world . And already in the United States you can see the first signs of an important transformation here as Americans save more and as we borrow substantially less from the rest of the world . \" \" I think we all recognize that we need to act before the memory of the crisis fades and before the impetus for reform recedes , \" he said . \" And we 're trying to bring greater urgency and commitment to the need to act together . \" The tightening of global financial regulations was expected to top the summit 's agenda and comes as some major economies are beginning to recover . Germany , France and Japan have announced that they have emerged from recession , prompting hopes that the worst of the financial crisis may have passed . G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors agreed at a meeting this month not to start cutting back just yet on stimulus efforts .

The legendary singer , who rose to fame during the folk movement of the 1950s and 1960s , is marking the occasion with a new album called \" Day After Tomorrow . \" Produced by Steve Earle ( whom Baez likes to call \" Mister Gruff \" ) , it 's a collection of bluegrass-tinged songs reminiscent of her early repertoire . \" We were looking for songs that feel like now but sound like back then , \" she said . Earle penned one of the album 's standout tracks , \" God Is God , \" which he describes as \" recovery speak . \" Baez also covers \" Scarlet Tide , \" a song written by Elvis Costello and T Bone Burnett for the 2003 film \" Cold Mountain . \" At 67 , Baez finds her voice may not have the sheer power it did in her 20s , but her political spirit is intact . She passionately expressed her support for Barack Obama during the presidential campaign , the first time the self-described pacifist has taken sides in party politics . \" I have n't heard an orator like that since King , \" she said . Baez knew the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. and famously sang the protest song \" We Shall Overcome \" to a massive crowd at the Lincoln Memorial during King 's 1963 March on Washington . Baez spoke to CNN about sustaining her voice and finding happiness in her 60s . The following is an edited version of that interview , which was conducted before Tuesday 's election . CNN : What did Steve Earle bring to the table with your new album ? Joan Baez : Oh , everything but the voice . Spirit , some songs . His gruffness to my non-gruffness . He worked fast , really fast , and I like that . And he brought the musicians . I do n't know who to choose for musicians . We were a good match . CNN : Is there a song on the album that speaks to you more than others ? Baez : I guess the ones I go back listening to are \" God Is God \" and \" Rose of Sharon . \" \" Rose of Sharon \" sounds exactly like an old folk song . I would n't have guessed in a million years that it 's contemporary . CNN : How does it feel to be embarking on a new tour at such a politically charged time ? Baez : I 've never seen this country this politically charged . I realized something this morning . I was watching Obama on TV and I thought , \" I really love this guy . \" I love what he 's capable of , I love that he 's genuine . He 's a statesman , and he 's brilliant . People say do you think he can change America ? He already has . ... And I know most of the things he 'll have to do I would battle him to the death . He 's going to be commander in chief of the Army , Navy and Air Force , and I 'm a pacifist [ laughs ] . CNN : So you would almost prefer that he did n't run for president , that his talents could be applied in other ways ? Baez : Yeah . I 've thought that , yeah . Part of me wishes very strongly that Obama would be outside the system and his hands would be less tied . CNN : In the '50s and '60s , you lived and breathed the causes you rallied behind . When you look at young musicians today , do you feel they 're attaching themselves to charities or causes because it 's hip , rather than meaningful ? Baez : I think it 's probably a combination of things . I think people are afraid of risk so they 'll [ only ] go so far . But I do n't think people have felt the urgency that we felt in the '60s . But it 's there . The urgency is there . There 's a need for community , but we do n't feel it . CNN : Why is that ? Baez : That we do n't feel it ? Because we live more and more separately .

Still , my mother was safety-obsessed about some things , like swimming lessons . Year after year , she forced me to take them at our local pool in Iowa City . Having to go against my will seemed all the more unfair to me , since my mother could not swim and was actually afraid of the water . But my mother reasoned that if water came between her children and their safety , she would be helpless . \" I ca n't save you , \" she would calmly state in answer to my pleas to bow out of the lessons . \" So I 'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you can save yourself . \" Real Simple : Mother-daughter relationships It 's no wonder she embraced this philosophy of self-reliance . She knew how unexpectedly life can rob you of someone you care about . My parents adopted me as an infant and went on to have a biological child -- my brother , Jason -- a couple of years later . My dad was an electrician , and he died in an accident on the job when I was three . After his death , my mother had to raise us alone , and she was acutely aware that she was truly on her own , with no backup plan . She was fiercely strong and yet constantly fearful . I have almost no memories of my father . Instead I remember Mike Fieseler . He was a former industrial-arts teacher whom my mother dated off and on for much of my childhood . Jason and I were n't his biggest fans . He was a man of strict rules , while my mom 's approach could be more properly deemed overindulgent leniency . iReport.com : Share your bonding with dad memories We resented having to share the spotlight with him -- a sentiment that was particularly strong every Christmas morning , when we had to wait for him to arrive before we could open gifts . ( There is little a man can do to endear himself to children less than delaying Christmas-morning gratification . ) And when they stopped dating , when I was 15 , I was n't unhappy to see him go . Real Simple : Small , helpful gestures with big impact Then , on February 18 , 1991 , when I was 17 , my mother suddenly died of a brain aneurysm . One minute she was laughing with friends , enjoying an evening out ; the next , she was unconscious on the floor . She never woke up . Just 19 hours later , she was dead , leaving my 15-year-old brother and me orphans . In the moments of shock and horror that followed , my relatives all gathered in the hospital , and I went home with only a close friend for company ( Jason followed a while later ) . We spent that night on our own . I was numb ; it had all happened so fast . I could barely think beyond the immediate moment . The next morning , my grandfather , aunts , and uncles were still immersed in their own mourning . Shell-shocked as I was , I knew I had to let people know what had happened . I saw my mother 's address book lying where she had set it only days before and started dialing . One of the phone numbers I found was Mike 's . Even though he lived about an hour away , it felt like he was there in an instant . As soon as he walked in , he took charge -- and took care of Jason and me . Among other small kindnesses , he gave me a credit card and said , \" Why do n't you buy something to wear to the funeral ? \" He gave me permission to be a 17-year-old -- to focus on the more mundane issue of what I was going to wear instead of weighty adult concerns . Real Simple : Father 's Day gift ideas Generally , when children are orphaned , a family member comes forward to take them in . This did n't happen in our case . Everyone had a good reason , I suppose . My mom 's father was too old to assume responsibility for us ; my mother 's sister and her husband had three kids of their own and were n't able to take in any others ; her other two siblings were both single and worked long hours . The guardian named in my mother 's will was a babysitter that none of us had seen in 15 years . But I can tell you this : Abandonment , even for very good reasons , feels awful . It was heartbreaking and terrifying to have lost the person we loved most and then to be set adrift . Months passed and it felt like our relatives could offer no reassurances . The only news we got was that if Jason and I remained without a guardian , we would have to enter foster care . Our mother was gone , and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves . And , once again , there was Mike . After the funeral , he was a constant presence . He made sure that food filled the cupboards , the bills were paid , and the lawn was mowed . ( Mike 's adult daughter , Linda , pitched in and took care of his house . ) He made sure I went back to school even when it was the last thing I wanted to do . His overbearing personality -- the trait I had hated the most -- is what comforted me the most and got me through those difficult days . Mike says that Linda came up with the idea to make his role with Jason and me official -- he could become our guardian . He was on board right away . Mike still says he never considered not doing it ; caring for us was simply the right thing to do . One day he made us his offer . In a moment where the grief of loss and the pain of being unwanted threatened to capture my very breath , this man , whose only tie to us was having dated my mother , said he would be honored to take us in . From that moment on , everything was different . His girlfriend , Patty , threw us a \" guardian party \" when the paperwork became official . It was just a small gathering , but it made us feel special . I received a key chain with my initials , and I remember thinking that the idea behind it was so lovely . Over the years , Mike has become not merely a legal guardian but a real father to me . When I fell into depression in college , unable to get past thoughts of my mother and all I had lost , he was there to listen . When my husband , Eric , and I bought our first house , Mike spent weekends installing insulation and repairing our gutters . He never wrote me off as a good , mature kid who could handle everything herself . He walked the line between trusting me and recognizing when I might need help . And what more could you want from a father than that ? His was an unconventional path to parenthood , to say the least .

Being driven to Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow , the long goodbyes with my family and friends . I remember the faces of my crying mother , my puzzled father . They were afraid of what would happen to their son and their grandson in a strange land . As we were leaving , I had to brace myself for the possibility that I would not see my family again . After all , the Iron Curtain , although rusty and crumbling , was still around . The unknown lay ahead , and it was scary . Thirty-three years in the Soviet Union were over . I felt like our lives were about to start anew . For us , life in Moscow was actually not bad at all . Family and numerous friends always compensated for living behind the Iron Curtain and numerous day-to-day shortcomings . My generation grew up in a culture of near-deprivation , constant shortages of everything imaginable . But that was nothing compared with the lives of my parents and especially my grandparents ' . I recall how people used to stock up on everything . Everyone 's refrigerators were actually packed with food . And , as I said , we made it through with the support of friends and family . But since my early childhood , I had heard about the \" Zapad \" -- the West , in Russian . And the older I grew , the more attractive Zapad seemed . I can still visualize my grandfather opening a package from his brother , who lived in New York . Unheard-of luxuries : Parker pens and Gillette razors wrapped in glitzy plastic .

We experienced hospitality and goodwill like we never had before . My friend 's parents gave our family of four shelter and fed us for nearly two months . Once , they had been new immigrants , too .

Twitter has enabled people to express to the world their hopes for the elections , excitement at the chance of exercising their right to vote , jubilation in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's camp and shock and disappointment among Mossavi 's supporters .

Smart eating is not about settling for less ; it 's about heaping more good stuff on your plate . Three-grain pilaf is a both mouth-watering dish and a contains a dose of healthy carbs . Let 's change just one health habit a week -- shopping , cooking , and eating to meet that goal -- for four weeks ? After a month of making basic grains , fruit , and vegetables into staples using my recipes , you 'll find it much easier to plan delicious , satisfying meals . Try Laura Pensiero 's four-week approach to transforming your eating habits ! Week One : Make a produce-aisle hit list Eating more fruits and vegetables is one of the most important dietary habits you can adopt to prevent heart disease , cancer , diabetes , and hypertension and to manage your weight . Vegetables in particular will cost you little in the way of calories while offering huge health benefits . Your weekly goal is to eat five to nine servings of fruits and veggies a day . That 's not as challenging as it may seem . The serving sizes are reasonable one medium-size fruit , a half cup of cooked vegetables , three-quarters of a cup of 100-percent juice , one cup of raw leafy vegetables , a quarter cup of dried fruit . Mix fruit into your breakfast cereal , add lettuce and tomato to your sandwich ( with a side of a vegetable-based soup ) , eat a piece of fruit in the afternoon and a vegetable side at dinner , and you 've taken care of at least five servings . Before shopping , write down the names of five richly colored vegetables and fruits that you really like , then add to the list two that you 're curious about and are willing to try . Week Two : Defy your white flour urge Until recently , it seemed that only nutritionists ( and cereal box labels ) used the words whole grain . Now delicious whole grain soups , desserts , and breads -- bursting with color , texture and flavor -- have become popular . It 's also widely known that they have the power to deliver key antioxidants . Your weekly goal is to make sure that half of your grain servings per day ( three to five one-ounce servings ) are whole grains such as wild rice , brown rice , barley , bulgur , corn ( polenta ) , faro , quinoa , wheat berries , or whole wheat couscous . Whole grain foods are not refined , which means they contain all three parts of the grain , including the two lost in the refining process -- the outer layer , bran , which provides fiber , B vitamins , and antioxidants ; and the germ , the nutrient-packed inner portion , containing protein , vitamins , minerals , and antioxidants . The endosperm , the starchy part of the grain left in refined products such as white flour , contains some protein and lots of carbs but few nutrients . Look for the word whole on the ingredient list , followed by the name of the grain . Research shows that adding even a moderate amount of whole grain to your diet every day -- whole grain cereal topped with fruit for breakfast , toasty multigrain bread at lunch , and a pilaf or grain salad for dinner -- significantly reduces the risk of heart disease , type 2 diabetes , and digestive system and hormone-related cancers . Week Three : Get the perks of dairy -- without all the fat This week , add some reduced-fat dairy , which will cream up your cooking and get healthy calcium into your diet ( approximately 75 percent of adult Americans do n't get the recommended daily allowance ) . Studies show not only that calcium helps prevent osteoporosis but that getting enough calcium each day ( 1,000 milligrams from ages 19 to 50 and 1,200 milligrams after age 50 ) , along with adequate vitamin D ( 200 IU ; 400 IU after age 50 ) , helps control weight , lowers blood pressure , and may prevent certain types of cancer . Your goal is to eat three to four servings a day of low-fat cheeses , yogurt , and 1 percent or skim milk ; the calcium in dairy products is the most readily absorbed by your body . If you 're lactose intolerant , fortified soy products -- particularly those with calcium malate -- are a fine substitute in cooking and often contain similar amounts of protein , vitamin D , and calcium . I do not recommend fat-free dairy products , particularly cheese ; instead of getting creamy , bubbly , and brown in recipes", "3586": "Wednesday of two baby slings", "3587": "just a bit", "3588": "crash", "3589": "Samsung Galaxy Tab , the Motorola Xoom and even the Nook Color", "3590": "musician Marilyn Manson , and the bestseller \" Nineteen Minutes \" entered the spotlight post-Columbine", "3591": "$ 250,000 fine .

That was all we needed to see and hear . Save the armchair psychoanalysis for later . Maybe , much later . No one would have understood or indulged such yearnings as quickly or as intuitively as Michael Jackson . As surely as he was the King of Pop , Jackson was also a high priest of wish fulfillment . His performances as both precocious child and child-like adult made growing up or growing old the only unimaginable things in the known world . This Peter Pan mystique even became part of the Jackson brand to the point of naming his combination of retreat and theme park the Neverland Ranch . The promise of eternal youth was embedded in pop music way before Jackson and his four brothers emerged from the grit of Gary , Indiana , to jump-start Motown 's winning streak .

Earlier Friday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt 's government \" to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications . \" \" We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters , and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces , \" Clinton said Friday , referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces . \" At the same time , protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully , \" she said . \" As a partner , we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately , \" Clinton said . \" They need to view civil society as their partner , not a threat . \" Servers of Egypt 's main internet provider were down early Friday , including servers for the Egyptian government 's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo . Early Friday , Gibbs said that he is \" very concerned about violence in Egypt , \" tweeting that the \" government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet . \" But at least one internet service provider , Noor , was still working . The U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to \" defer non-essential travel to Egypt . \" \" U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes , \" the agency added in a written travel alert . The agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage . \" U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times , \" the statement said , urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone . Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier 's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday , and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest . President Barack Obama has requested \" multiple briefings \" on Egypt , White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday . He has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the target of the protesters ' anger , \" but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed , \" Vietor said . Former Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak \" without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States . \" \" I think that , if anything , one might ask why has n't President Mubarak called President Obama and said , 'Are you with me or against me ? ' I mean , that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration , \" Cohen said . Obama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued . \" It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances , \" he said this week . Vice President Joe Biden said on \" PBS NewsHour \" on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator .

The same is true at Friendfield Plantation outside Georgetown , South Carolina . This is a former slave house on Friendfield Plantation , where Michelle Obama 's family has roots . It 's not exactly \" Gone With the Wind , \" but what makes this overgrown 3,300 acres of marsh and pine trees stand out is this : The family of first lady Michelle Obama believes her great-great grandfather was held as a slave here and labored in the mosquito-infested rice fields . It makes Friendfield Plantation a symbol of something more than servitude . It 's the symbol of something that 's never happened before , one important segment of an American family 's journey from the humiliation of slavery to the very top of the nation 's ruling class . CNN recently was the first television network allowed to visit the plantation and shoot video . It 's not a museum . It 's just private land , still with shadows of its past . Friendfield 's most distinctive historical feature , perhaps , is the dirt road known as Slave Street . Stroll across the plantation with CNN 's Joe Johns \u00bb Six white-washed little shacks are all that remain of the slave quarters , even though rows of these houses once stood on the property . About 350 slaves lived here during the 19th century . The houses are nothing special -- no plumbing , of course . The wooden walls are paper thin in places . It would have been hot and humid in summer , and most certainly cold in winter , although the shacks had fireplaces . They would have been crowded : probably one or two families living in a space smaller than a modern-day garage . The White House is some 472 miles from Georgetown , South Carolina . But long before Michelle Obama was born , her great-great grandfather , Jim Robinson , likely toiled in the fields here six days a week , from sunup to sundown . The place he probably called home was a little white shack smaller than -- by comparison -- a Secret Service security shed on the grounds of the executive mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . All told , hundreds of people lived like this , on this one plantation alone . \" Anywhere between 200 to 500 at different times , \" said Ed Carter , the property manager . \" The older the plantation got , they kept adding on more cabins . [ Some ] cabins are 1847 . \" There was some on the other street that were about probably 1820s . And when they added on , got a bit more wealthy , they just kept adding on more slaves , more cabins . \" Watch Obama 's recent comments on slavery \u00bb The shacks probably were n't much refuge from the vicious clouds of mosquitoes , chiggers and other pests that still impinge on a person 's every move on the plantation . Then , consider the dangers of the alligators and snakes . There was also the oppressive heat and humidity of South Carolina . And on the day CNN visited , the skies opened up in a violent rainstorm . Add up all of these factors and you begin to get a picture of what life probably was , and was not , for the slaves on Friendfield Plantation . Workers on the rice plantation -- and Friendfield was one of the largest in these parts -- faced all these elements , plus the threat of disease , including malaria and yellow fever . And unlike the CNN crew , the slaves were not free to leave . Even in death , the slaves stayed . Three cemeteries are on the Friendfield grounds .

After a Nigerian 's attempt to blow up an airliner preparing to land in Detroit , Michigan , on Christmas Day , a growing number of critics have called for either the elimination or a total overhaul of the agency . Last week , President Obama asked Congress for an additional $ 85 million to boost the air marshals program , known by its acronym FAMS , after the foiled attack aboard the jet coming from the Netherlands . U.S. officials have charged Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab with attempting to blow up the airliner . He was subdued by passengers and crew .

However , in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing . The murky story began in June of this year , when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena , Italy . It then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari 's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren 's chief designer Mike Coughlan . Coughlan 's wife , Trudy Coughlan , had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren 's Woking headquarters . An employee of the copy shop , suspicious that confidential data was being copied , blew the whistle to Ferrari . Ferrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney , a friend and former colleague of Coughlan 's ( the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s ) . Stepney had been the team 's chief mechanic , but in February took his new role as the team 's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari 's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn . Ferrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena , Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation .

It was a heated debate in the Middle East at the time -- whether [ the invasion ] was the right decision and whether the Americans had bad intentions or not . \" iReport.com : Did Obama make the right call on photos last week ? The fallout was immediate , both overseas and at home . A year into the Iraq war , the American public had grown increasingly uneasy about the direction of the war , and the Abu Ghraib photographs gave anti-war protesters the ammunition they needed to rally around their cause and question Bush administration policies . See Bush administration interrogation tactics \u00bb A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll immediately after the photos were released showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans said the mistreatment of the detainees was unjustified under any circumstances . Bush 's overall performance rating sank to what was then the lowest of his presidency , 46 percent . The poll also showed support for the war at its lowest since before it began , with only 44 percent saying they believed it was worthwhile . See some of the disturbing photos ( discretion advised ) \u00bb It was a blow from which the administration , especially then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , never fully recovered . Amanpour said Obama 's presidential victory and big wins by Democrats in the House and Senate were proof of that . \" The American people said that they wanted their good name , the name of their country , the influence and credibility of their country 's standing , to be restored in the rest of the world , \" she said . The photos did what a print report could not do . They showed front-and-center what human rights groups had been saying for months : that the Bush administration was abusing prisoners within U.S. custody . Some photos showed naked prisoners piled on top of each other like a pyramid . Another showed a smiling female U.S. soldier giving a thumbs-up next to a naked , hooded prisoner . As a result of the furor unleashed by the pictures , 11 American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses , and some officers were reprimanded . Al-Rashed said he had expected violations in war , but nothing like \" humiliating individuals in those kinds of scenes . \" The Middle East has a \" bloody , long , bad record about torture of prisoners , \" he said , but what happened at Abu Ghraib was even more reprehensible because it undercut America 's democratic values . \" You talk about democracy , you talk about the respect of individuality , the freedom . ... The prison pictures just really made us speechless . \" \" It was something completely new -- something that we had not seen before in all the dictionary of prisoners and torture and mistreatment . It just weakened the argument completely about the wisdom of getting rid of a regime like Saddam . It made the argument for the other side stronger . \" The photographs had a direct impact within the Iraq insurgency . Just days after the photos became public , American contractor Nicholas Berg was beheaded -- with his executioners saying they were retaliating for Abu Ghraib abuses . The insurgents posted video of the killing on the Internet for all to see . \" The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals , \" Obama said . \" In fact , the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion , and to put our troops in greater danger . \" Watch Obama explain reversing course \u00bb The court had ordered the release in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union .

Blackwater 's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America 's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm 's way overseas . Under the direction and oversight of the United States government , Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States . Words alone can not express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions . I am proud to be there to represent them today . After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL , I founded Blackwater in 1997 . I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues . Ten years later , Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day . After 9/11 , when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq , the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas . Blackwater responded immediately . We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country . Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans , many of whom have recent military deployments . No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured . There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men . At the same time , 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates . Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed . The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives . Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families . The areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging . Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq . We 're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis . Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe , including visiting members of Congress . In doing so , more American service members are available to fight the enemy . Blackwater shares the committee 's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations . The company 's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes , treaties and regulations of the United States . Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented . The worldwide personnel protection services contract , which has been provided to this committee , was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance , including the hiring , vetting guidelines , background checks , screening , training standards , rules of force and conduct standards . In Iraq , Blackwater reports to the embassy 's regional security officer , or RSO . All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO . In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls , the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions , as well as any applicable laws and regulations . We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation 's total force . Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions .

As a person of faith , I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering . I believe we have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research -- and the humanity and conscience to do so responsibly . \" Watch as Obama announces he 's lifting the funding ban \u00bb The president pledged to develop \" strict guidelines \" to ensure that such research \" never opens the door to the use of cloning for human reproduction . \" Such a possibility , he maintained , is \" dangerous , profoundly wrong and has no place in our society or any society . \" Obama 's order directs the NIH to develop revised guidelines on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research within 120 days , according to Dr. Harold Varmus , president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and co-chairman of Obama 's science advisory council . \" The president is , in effect , allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it 's permitted by law -- that is , work with stem cells themselves , not the derivation of stem cells , \" Varmus said in a conference call with reporters Sunday . While conceding that \" the full promise of stem cell research remains unknown \" and \" should not be overstated , \" Obama nevertheless expressed hope that the order will help spur faster progress in the search for cures to afflictions such as Parkinson 's disease , cancer and spinal cord injuries . See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research \u00bb Researchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body . Stem cells have this ability for a short time . A few days before the embryo would implant in the uterus , it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus . Watch a doctor explain why embryotic stem cells are so important \u00bb When the embryo is 4 or 5 days old , scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish . With the removal of these stem cells -- of which there may be about 30 -- the embryo is destroyed . Twenty-one of the 60 stem cell lines authorized for research under the Bush policy have proven useful to researchers . Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez spoke highly of President Obama at the United Nations on Thursday . He also expressed a fondness for American people and culture , saying he likes the movie actor Charles Bronson and the poet Walt Whitman . He loves to sing , he said , though he does not do it well . And Chavez had kind words for the U.S. security detail protecting him during his visit to New York , saying he chatted with them while out walking and that they \" have been very gracious , very efficient and very attentive , very kind . \" In an exclusive interview with CNN 's Larry King , Chavez spoke at length about a host of issues : relations between Venezuela and the United States and his hopes for improved ties with President Barack Obama ; Iran , Israel and those who deny that the Holocaust existed ; efforts to overthrow him and have him assassinated ; criticism that he is power hungry and trying to silence critics . Chavez , a self-proclaimed socialist , spoke with King a few hours after giving a speech to the U.N. General Assembly , in which he praised Obama but criticized some U.S. policies . Watch Chavez speak at the U.N. General Assembly \u00bb When asked whether he is misunderstood in the United States , Chavez seemed to turn reflective . \" I 'm a man with many defects , \" he said . \" I love . I sing . I dream . I was born in the poor countryside . I was raised in the countryside , planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother . My children , my two daughters are with me and I want a better world for my grandchildren , for your grandchildren . \" Now , they demonize me . But that 's the start of these world campaigns to try to defend what you can not defend -- a system that is destroying the world . ... I 'm a Christian . I want the world of justice and equality . This is the only way to achieve peace . \" Chavez then talked about his religious upbringing and current faith . \" I was an altar boy , \" he said . \" My mother wanted me to be a priest . I am very Christian and Catholic . ... I 'm very faithful . I believe in God , in Jesus Christ . I love Jesus Christ . I am a Christian . ... I cry when I see injustice , children dying of hunger . \" His comments were all the more remarkable because Chavez and the Catholic Church have been at odds since he came to power in 1999 . The church has been one of his major critics , with Pope Benedict XVI and other church leaders expressing concern over what they see as attempts by Chavez to limit the church 's influence . Chavez 's efforts to change anti-abortion laws have been at the top of those concerns . Chavez , in turn , has referred to church leadership as a \" tumor . \" Speaking of other matters , Chavez said he hopes for improved relations with Obama , but \" we want relations based on respect , relations of peoples where we are respected . \" That has not been the case so far , he said . \" Most governments in the United States in a hundred years have not respected the peoples of Latin America , \" Chavez told King . \" They have sponsored coup d'etats , assassinations .

Since Mattel introduced Barbie in 1959 , she has become a household name -- owned by 90 percent of American girls ages 3 to 10 and sold in 150 countries , said Lauren Dougherty , a Mattel spokeswoman . Barbie attracts 50 million visitors to her Web site each month , she added . See Barbie dolls from all over the world \u00bb Along the way , she spawned a cosmetics line , apparel stores throughout Asia and an entertainment franchise that has sold more than 65 million DVDs . Watch old toys get new life \u00bb Last week , a six-story flagship store opened in Shanghai , China . And a real-life Malibu Dream House , a temporary home tricked out for Barbie 's birthday -- including a chandelier made of her hair -- is currently on display in California . Not bad for a doll that , according to author Robin Gerber , was initially inspired by \" a sexually-themed gag toy for men . \" The now-legendary doll was conceived by Ruth Handler , a daughter of Polish immigrants , said Gerber , author of the newly published \" Barbie and Ruth : The Story of the World 's Most Famous Doll and the Woman Who Created Her . \" She and her husband , Elliott , owned Mattel until a scandal involving accusations of cooked books drove them out in 1975 , Gerber said . Handler , who died in 2002 , used to watch her own daughter , Barbara , play with paper dolls . Then , on a trip to Europe , Barbara became fascinated with a buxom doll that Gerber said was based on a female German cartoon character , named Lilli , who used sex to get what she wanted . \" My guess is she did n't know what it was when she bought it , \" because at that point , four years after the Lilli doll 's release , it had landed in European toy stores , the author explained . Handler took the doll back to the states and insisted Mattel designers get to work . \" Who would have thought , \" Gerber said . Barbie was thought up by a woman and modeled on a cartoon character \" who was essentially a prostitute . \" Though the men at Mattel , a company that had never sold dolls before , were skeptical at best , Handler proved to be \" a corporate genius , \" Gerber said . In the three years after Barbie 's release , Mattel 's worth grew to $ 200 million , doubling the value earned in the first 20 years of business . Handler 's daughter , now Barbara Segal , 67 , is a bit dumbfounded by all the hype . \" It 's been quite an interesting ride , \" she said from her Los Angeles , California , area home . \" I ca n't believe this doll 's created all of this . \" Barbie 's collector line ( not what 's seen on Wal-Mart shelves ) is designed for the grown-ups who still relish Barbie .

Tour an iReporter 's Barbie dream house \u00bb She says the doll can evoke powerful emotions and has seen visitors weep for a lost sibling or childhood friend . But Holder , 51 , who gave up a nursing career to pursue her Barbie dream more than 20 years ago , said that while trips to the museum can be emotional , they 're also full of laughter and stories . \" No one leaves without sharing a fond portion of their childhood with me , \" said Holder , who once snagged a record for selling a doll at auction for $ 27,600 . Barbie , however , does n't conjure up smiles for everyone . Though the 11.5-inch doll ca n't be single-handedly blamed for the eating disorders and body-image issues that plague young women , Ellyn Kaschak , a psychology professor at San Jose Sate University in California , said Barbie , especially given her prevalence , is part of the problem . \" I do n't think the concerns are overblown at all , \" said Kaschak , one of the founders in the 1970s of the feminist psychology field . \" Blow her up to normal [ human ] size , and she 'd fall over , \" she said of Barbie 's unattainable figure . Still standing , however , is Cindy Jackson , a 53-year-old woman inspired by Barbie to do much more than collect dolls and splurge on matching outfits . Over the course of more than two decades , Jackson has gone under the knife for 13 full-scale operations , including multiple procedures each time , and hundreds of less intrusive cosmetic tune-ups in order to achieve the \" all-American beauty \" look she said Barbie represents . She grew up in rural Ohio , \" plain and unpopular , \" she said . \" Every real woman around me was a farmer 's wife , a factory worker , a mother or a school teacher . ... For me , it was soul-destroying . There was no glamour whatsoever . \" And then she met her first Barbie , a vintage doll sporting a bubble cut , \" a sidelong glance \" and dressed as Jackie Kennedy , she remembered . \" It was powerful , \" Jackson said from her London , England , home . \" I 'd never seen a real woman who looked like that , and I thought , 'That 's what I want to look like .

McLaren team chief Ron Dennis arrives for the hearing in Paris . In an official press statement , the FIA stated : \" The WMSC has stripped Vodafone McLaren Mercedes of all constructor points in the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship and the team can score no points for the remainder of the season . \" Furthermore , the team will pay a fine equal to $ 100m , less the FOM [ Formula One Management ] income lost as a result of the points deduction . \" However , due to the exceptional circumstances in which the FIA gave the team 's drivers an immunity in return for providing evidence , there is no penalty in regard to drivers ' points . \" Should McLaren 's drivers , Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton , win in any of the remaining races of the 2007 season no representatives of McLaren will be allowed on the podium . The WMSC is expected to announce the reasons for its decisions on September 14 . In July the WMSC ruled that McLaren was in breach of Article 151c of the FIA International Sporting Code but recommended that no punitive measures were taken until a hearing of the FIA 's International Court of Appeal on September 13 . However , in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing . The murky story began in June of this year , when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena , Italy . It then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari 's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren 's chief designer Mike Coughlan . Coughlan 's wife , Trudy Coughlan , had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren 's Woking headquarters . An employee of the copy shop , suspicious that confidential data was being copied , blew the whistle to Ferrari . Ferrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney , a friend and former colleague of Coughlan 's ( the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s ) . Stepney had been the team 's chief mechanic , but in February took his new role as the team 's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari 's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn . Ferrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena , Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation . Ferrari issued the following press statement : \" Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal , concerning the theft of technical information . Furthermore , legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer . This produced a positive outcome . \" McLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan , its chief designer . It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss , Nick Fry , in June this year to discuss employment possibilities . However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda . Coughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10 . Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan 's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation . The furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC 's verdict . Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty . But now the FIA is in possession of new evidence . Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso . On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa , Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated : \" The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession , or that such drivers have recently been in possession , of written evidence relevant to this investigation . \" The letter continued : \" I can confirm , given the importance of this issue , that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the International Sporting Code or the Formula One regulations . However , in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information , serious consequences could follow . \" Five days later the WMSC announced it was to reconvene \" following the emergence of new evidence \" , in place of the Court of Appeal hearing . Other rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa in practice leading up to the Monaco Grand Prix . Stepney has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general . Further drama overshadowed Alonso and Hamilton 's one-two on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday .

The Swede is in doubt for Tuesday 's Champions League trip to German club Stuttgart due to a swollen ankle . Midfielder Andres Iniesta took advantage of some slack defending to pounce for his first goal this season in the seventh minute , hooking home a left-foot effort after the ball ran loose in his 300th outing for the club . France striker Thierry Henry , handed a rare start due to Ibrahimovic 's absence , netted a free-kick in the 29th minute after driving a shot through the defensive wall for his first goal this year . Center-back Rafael Marquez marked his return from suspension with a similar effort nine minute later as he curled a set-piece over the wall and in off the post . Barca took their foot off the pedal in the second half , but 18-year-old Thiago scored his first senior goal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot after Lionel Messi set him up with a cutback .

I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era . Sooner or later , all honeymoons for presidents come to an end . This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story , in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers . In the few months President Obama has been in office , the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media , too : \" Is he as good as we all hoped ? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him ? Can he get the job done ? Could anyone ? \" Democrats will add pensively to the words : \" Not Done \" from the \" SNL \" skit , \" Not yet . \" Republicans would add assertively : \" Not ever ! \" Democrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \" Camelot II \" ; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes . Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson . Republicans have no hope left about Obama . At best , they pray , for the good of the country that he 's not as bad as Jimmy Carter . But in reality , they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure . At a time of fiscal crisis , President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him . His campaign was brilliant , and he won against two inferior campaigns , though not necessarily inferior candidates . Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president . John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition . Every president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing . Governing is tough every day . Campaigning can be fun . It 's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected . Reagan did it . Bill Clinton did it . George W. Bush did it . And this president likes to do it , and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech , coast to coast .

Carrillo Leyva , 32 , was presented at the news conference , surrounded by black-clad , hooded law-enforcement officials .

The same reward has been offered for his uncle , cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes , also known as \" El Viceroy \" and \" El General , \" who remains at-large . Rewards of $ 2 million apiece have been offered for 22 other leading cartel suspects . Wednesday 's arrest was the fourth detention of a top drug cartel leader in recent weeks .

Talamantes , also known as \" El Canicon , \" also is suspected in attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon , the state-run Notimex agency said . That same week , the Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant .

( CNN ) -- Far from flowing rainbow flags , the sound of Lady Gaga and , quite honestly , white people , stands a nightclub just outside of Wicker Park in Chicago , Illinois , by the name of The Prop House . The line to get in usually stretches down the block , and unlike many of the clubs in Boystown and Andersonville , this one plays hip-hop and caters to men who may or may not openly identify as gay , but without question are black and proud . And a good number of them are tired of hearing how the gay community is disappointed in President Obama , because they are not . In recent weeks , one would have thought the nation 's first black president was also the nation 's biggest homophobe . Everyone from Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black and radio personality Rachel Maddow to Joe Solmonese , the president of Human Rights Campaign , the country 's largest gay advocacy group , seem to be blasting Obama for everything from \" do n't ask do n't tell \" to Adam Lambert not winning American Idol . In their minds , Obama is not moving fast enough on behalf of the GLBT community . The outcry is not completely without merit -- the Justice Department 's unnerving brief on the Defense of Marriage Act immediately comes to mind . I was upset by some of the statements , but not surprised . ( After the Tuskegee Syphilis Study , President Ronald Reagan 's initial handling of AIDS and , more recently , Katrina , there is little that surprises me when it comes to the government and the treatment of its people . ) Still , rarely has criticism regarding Obama and the GLBT community come from the kind of person you would find standing in line at a spot like The Prop House , and there 's a reason for that . Despite the catchiness of the slogan , gay is not the new black . Black is still black . And if any group should know this , it 's the gay community . Bars such as The Prop House , or Bulldogs in Atlanta , Georgia , exist because a large number of gay blacks -- particularly those who date other blacks , and live in the black community -- do not feel a part of the larger gay movement . There are Gay Pride celebrations , and then there are Black Gay Prides . There 's a popular bar in the heart of the nation 's capital that might as well rename itself Antebellum , because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor . Last year at the annual Human Rights Campaign national fundraiser in Washington , D.C. -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment . When Proposition 8 passed in California , white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent . At protest rallies that followed , some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants . Not to split hairs , but for most blacks , the n-word trumps the f-word . So while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television , blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry . They see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets . And then there is the history . The 40th anniversary of Stonewall dominated Gay Pride celebrations around the country , and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized , 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood-soaked years black people have been through in this country . There are stories some blacks lived through , stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told . While those who were at Stonewall talk about the fear of being arrested by police , 40 years ago , blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated . The 13th Amendment was signed in 1865 , and it was n't until 1948 that President Harry S Truman desegregated the military . That 's more than an 80-year gap . Not to be flip , but Miley Cyrus is older than Bill Clinton 's \" do n't ask , do n't tell . \" That does n't mean that the safety of gay people should be trivialized or that Obama should not be held accountable for the promises he made on the campaign trail . But to call this month 's first-ever White House reception for GLBT leaders \" too little too late \" is akin to a petulant child throwing a tantrum because he wants to eat his dessert before dinner . This is one of the main reasons why so many blacks bristle at the comparison of the two movements -- everybody wants to sing the blues , nobody wants to live them . This lack of perspective is only going to alienate a black community that is still very proud of Obama and is hypersensitive about any criticism of him , especially given he 's been in office barely six months . If blacks are less accepting of gays than other racial groups -- and that is certainly debatable -- then the parade of gay people calling Obama a \" disappointment \" on television is counterproductive in gaining acceptance , to say the least . And the fact that the loudest critics are mostly white does n't help matters either . Hearing that race matters in the gay community may not be comforting to hear , but that does n't make it any less true .

A group of Australian and American researchers recently spent a month hundreds of kilometers southwest of the Tasmanian coast , exploring the fracture 's depths . This funnel-shaped sea squirt , never before seen , will snap shut like a Venus flytrap around shrimp that are unfortunate enough to go near it . Jess Adkins , a professor at Caltech and one of the project 's lead scientists , remembers sitting in his control room and watching the underwater life on his monitors with a sense of awe . Once , he says , none of the scientists or pilots said a word for 10 minutes straight as their submersible glided over an undiscovered coral reef full of urchins and sponges and sea stars . The researchers explored the fracture with Jason , a remotely-operated submersible the size of a small car . On loan from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute , it carried a high-definition camera that weighed more than 500 pounds and beamed underwater video up to the ship through a long fiber-optic tether . At 3,000 meters below sea level , the crew saw thousands of sea spiders . At 3,500 , millions of specimens of a new , purple-spotted sea anemone . At 4,000 meters , a single never-before-seen carnivorous sea squirt with a funnel-shaped body that snapped shut like a Venus flytrap around any shrimp unfortunate enough to brush against it . Back on land , the three new species ( the anemone , the sea squirt , and a new kind of barnacle ) have drawn the most attention , but it 's the team 's coral collection , some 10,000 pieces of it , that can tell us about the history of our climate and , perhaps , its future . A coral skeleton acts as a tape recorder of its environment . As it grows , the coral 's chemical structure ( specifically the weight of its oxygen molecules ) varies depending on the temperature of the water around it . And , because the coral 's uranium decays into thorium over time , it is conveniently datable . By charting different corals ' ages and oxygen weights , researchers can map the ocean 's changing temperature . During the coming months , expedition scientists will compare 40,000 years of oceanic and atmospheric records . The ocean 's temperature and carbon dioxide levels are important because of their impact on our atmosphere . The watery part of the world absorbs and stores sixty times more CO2 than the atmosphere .

Eight U.S. senators called earlier Monday for an independent federal investigation of whether oil giant BP violated civil or criminal laws in connection with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . It has n't been determined when Obama will make the announcement of the presidential commission or when he 'll sign the executive order , said the official , who did not want to speak on the record ahead of an announcement . \" The commission will take into account the investigations under way concerning the causes of the spill and explore a range of issues , \" the official said . In particular , the commission 's inquiry will focus on industry practices , rig safety , regulatory regimes , federal governmental oversight -- including the structure and functions of the Minerals Management Service -- and environmental review and other protections , the official said . Last week , Obama harshly criticized the companies involved in the spill , which threatens to become one of the nation 's worst environmental disasters , and pledged to break up what he called the cozy relationship between regulators and the oil industry . In testimony on Capitol Hill , BP touted its progress toward plugging the spill , but a top Obama administration official said the disaster is far from over . Officials grilled on oil spill \" We are in the middle of this crisis . We are not at the beginning , \" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a Senate committee Monday afternoon . \" We 've been at it a month almost , but we are not near the end as well . \" BP has successfully inserted a siphon into the damaged riser pipe from the underwater well at the heart of the spill . The procedure has allowed the company to collect more than 1,000 barrels ( 42,000 gallons ) of oil a day that would otherwise spill into the Gulf , said Doug Suttles , the company 's chief operating officer . That , combined with the use of chemical dispersants to break up the spill , has reduced the amount of oil reaching the surface , he said . \" This [ is ] probably the smallest amount of oil I 've seen on the surface since the effort began , \" Suttles said . The well had been spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day into the Gulf since late April , when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana . Eleven workers are presumed dead after the sinking , and the cause has not been determined . Some of the oil has washed ashore on the Louisiana coast , and tar balls related to the spill have turned up as far east as Dauphin Island , Alabama . Some estimates put the amount of oil gushing from the well far higher than the 5,000-barrel-per-day estimate made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a few days after the spill began . Samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface . Samantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia , told CNN 's \" American Morning \" that the size of the suspected plumes is hard to determine . \" Nothing like it has really ever been seen in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico before , \" she said . \" It 's not only a large feature , but it 's a very complex feature . There 's a lot of vertical structure to it . \" But federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed . Charlie Henry , a scientific adviser from NOAA , said descriptions of \" layers of oil \" beneath the Gulf were \" totally untrue . \" \" They were able to detect what we think is hydrocarbons in the water column .

Even in the early 1990s , doctors told transsexual people that we should not socialize together , because people might notice there were things about us that were different from \" normal \" people . Many transsexual women were tall and some had broad shoulders , large hands and feet . Most transsexual men were on the short side , and had small hands and feet . It 's one thing if you mix in with other people where there is a lot of physical diversity , but if you congregate with others like you , you may risk discovery . To be discovered as a transsexual person was a horrible fate . And fitting in , being \" normal , \" was the goal of treatment , after all . I was convinced that having a \" sex change \" was going to be a very straightforward process . I would take the hormones , have some surgery , and then go home and mow my lawn . I expected life to just be ordinary , just the way it was supposed to be . There were a few surprises in store for me , though , not the least of which was that I learned that the fear and shame of being known or discovered to be a transsexual person was probably responsible for a tremendous amount of suffering . I learned that people like me hid themselves from the world , often were under-employed or unemployed , avoided seeing physicians when they were ill , and often expected that they would never have intimate partners . After I began transition , I met more and more transsexual men like myself , and I saw firsthand the fear and shame that limited their lives . These were kind , gentle , thoughtful , serious men , and they did not deserve to live in a state of fear and shame . I knew then that education about who we were , and what our lives were like , would be absolutely necessary to do two things : first to let people like me know we were not alone and we did n't have to be afraid ; and second to let other people know we existed , to make the world safe for us , for our difference and our uniqueness . Like a handful of other trans men in North America , Europe , England , and Japan , I began to do public education , to write about our experience , and to educate legislators and policy makers , helping them change the laws , hoping to ease the suffering of others like ourselves who would follow in our footsteps .

We talk to his parents about the practice regime they implemented from the age of 4 , and the ruthless work ethic that they believe has brought him success . Lang Lang has made it his mission to share classical music around the world , with an emphasis on training children through outreach programs . Following his performance at the opening of Beijing 's 2008 Olympic Games , he became a symbol of the youth and future of China . This status has inspired over 35 million Chinese children to learn to play classical piano - a phenomenon popularly referred to as \" the Lang Lang effect . \" Revealed documents the days leading up to Lang Lang 's next major Chinese performance . He has been selected by the government to perform in celebrations of the 60-year Anniversary of the People 's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square , a fitting performance for the prodigy who is seen to embody modern China . The frenzy surrounding Lang Lang in China inspired iconic piano maker Steinway to create their first piano branded in someone 's name . On a visit to the Steinway shop along the way , Lang Lang meets two aspiring young pianists , and Revealed captures an impromptu masterclass with the two young boys . Lang Lang is not however everyone 's cup of tea .

But Lang Lang is not concerned about that . His mission is to spread a love of music and popularize classical works . Revealed follows him to the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland , where he teams up with his hero , Jazz legend Hancock . The feeling of admiration is entirely mutual , and for Hancock who has not played classical repertoire in many years , he is feeling out of his depth . \" Lang Lang is totally amazing , I 'm pretty terrified to be up on stage playing alongside him .

Other organizations , including the United Nations ' Human Rights Council , Amnesty International and the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights , have criticized the Israeli military 's conduct in Gaza . Israel has questioned the legitimacy of those claims , as well . The stories presented by Breaking the Silence are anonymous accounts which CNN can not independently verify . The group said that the soldiers were not willing to speak with the media . In response to the report 's allegations , the Israeli military said it complied with international law on all fronts .

Her presence is grudging , although CNN got advance permission to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was faring . Nujood is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago . Then , there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child , a portrait of innocence . She had a shy smile , playful nature and a whimsical giggle . Her retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting . Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World 's Untold Stories \u00bb The story was supposed to end with the divorce . There was , though , a stunning transformation . The young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph . Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world . In the fall of 2008 , Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine 's Woman of the Year , alongside some of the world 's most impressive women . She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman . There is a tell-all book , which is to be published in more than 20 languages , and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties . Nujood 's strength was celebrated by complete strangers . But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform ? \" There is no change at all since going on television , \" Nujood says bitterly . \" I hoped there was someone to help us , but we did n't find anyone . It has n't changed a thing . They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me . I wish I had never spoken to the media . \" Nujood says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off . There was never going to be a fortune . Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school , but she refuses to attend , according to Shada Nasser , the human rights lawyer who took on the child 's divorce case . \" I know Nujood was absent from the school . I spoke with her father and her family . And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school . But they said , 'You know we do n't have the money for the transportation . Do n't have the money for the food , ' \" says Nasser . She believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune . Nujood 's parents say they 've received nothing , and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way . \" I was happy I got divorced but I 'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television , \" she said , adding that she feels like an outcast even among family and friends . Nujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly . And yet , as a wife , she was spared nothing . \" I did n't want to sleep with him but he forced me to , he hit me , insulted me , \" she said . She described being married and living as a wife at such a young age as sheer torture . Nujood described how she was beaten and raped and how , after just a few weeks of marriage , she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement . But her parents told her they could not protect her , that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate . CNN tried to get comment from the girl 's ex-husband and family , but they declined . Nujood 's parents , like many others in Yemen , struck a social bargain . More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18 , many times to older men , some with more than one wife . Marriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents . But Nujood 's parents say they did not expect the girl 's new husband to demand sex from his child bride . To escape , Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge . After several hours , a judge finally went to see her . \" And he asked me , 'what do you want ' and I said 'I want a divorce ' and he said 'you 're married ? ' And I said 'yes . ' \" says Nujood . Nujood 's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing , and the girl was put in the care of Nasser . It seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with her that she should get her divorce . But based on the principles of Shariah law , her husband was compensated , not prosecuted . Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $ 200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $ 1 a day . Khadije Al Salame is working to help the girl get her life back . Now a Yemeni diplomat , she too was a child bride 30 years ago . But when she left her husband , she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood . She said : \" It 's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out , but the problem is it 's too much pressure on her . \" She does n't understand what 's going on . She 's a little girl and we have to understand as media people that we should leave her alone now . If we really love Nujood then we should just let her go to school and continue with her life , because education is the most important thing for her . \" To get her divorce , Nujood showed character and strength not easily expressed by women in Yemen , let alone a 10-year-old child bride", "4708": "sulfur", "4709": "The pilot told him that after he lost power in the first engine", "4710": "Angela Lansbury", "4711": "A man from Zimbabwe wheels his sick relative to a cholera clinic", "4712": "after the jury received the case for deliberations", "4713": "her pet", "4714": "increased border security", "4715": "diversity", "4716": "Miami", "4717": "\" Birthday Cake \" and \" Cockiness ( Love It ) \"", "4718": "Friday", "4719": "teachers who can be his allies on education reform", "4720": "Jose Theodore", "4721": "more than $ 1 trillion", "4722": "the woman at the center of the John Edwards sex scandal", "4723": "middle classes", "4724": "just inches away from her face", "4725": "Nine", "4726": "\" it says", "4727": "police cruisers", "4728": "U.N.

He has been selected by the government to perform in celebrations of the 60-year Anniversary of the People 's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square , a fitting performance for the prodigy who is seen to embody modern China .

Member of Sharjah royal family and one of Forbes ' 100 most powerful women , Sheikha Lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of United Arab Emirates in 2004 . Her background is in IT and before the government appointment worked at the Dubai Ports Authority where she gained the \" Distinguished Government Employee Award \" in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes . In 2000 , Sheikha Lubna founded Tejari , the first Middle Eastern business-to-business marketplace . As a result of Tejari ( Arabic for commerce ) 70 percent of Dubai 's government purchases are made online , while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch . One of the cornerstones of Sheikha Lubna 's work has been to allow for foreign ownership , so when John Defterios met up with her , he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy . Sheikha Lubna : We are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors . We will evaluate each sector , from the service side , finance , accounting . And any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth , then we will focus on that : on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company . Defterios : If you look at the Middle East , specifically within this Gulf region , it 's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership . Is this society in the region ready for this move ? Sheikha Lubna : Interestingly , the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside . We host 200 nationalities , so for us , the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community . So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path : it 's an organic path to continue the openness that exists . Foreign direct investment is not your own wealth . When you have your own wealth , you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes , because it 's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure . However , if you look at foreign direct investment , it mandates you to be much more transparent , you have to be very diligent about your work , and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment . Defterios : It 's interesting , you read the front line of the DP World , P & O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress . What are the lessons , not just from the UAE perspective , but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process ? Sheikha Lubna : First of all , I think it is important to understand , in this global world , there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere . Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad . We 've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad . And we 've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East , Australia , Asia as well as in Europe and the United States . What 's more important to understand is that if you 're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I do n't want to sell to this particular organization versus another , there are other places . Defterios : That 's not a veiled message your saying , that 's pretty forthright this comment . Sheikha Lubna : But it 's a message to all of us . If today I lock up my investment opportunity here , money will not come to me , money will go somewhere else . When I have investment coming from abroad , it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image ' . So when I say it , I am not directing this as a message to a particular country . I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation , when it comes to responsibility , when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country . So that 's really a lesson that 's very very critical . Defterios : A number of firsts : the first to start a B2B marketplace ; the first female minister within the country , an economy minister ; and the first to launch a perfume range as well . What is it all about ? Trailblazing , setting examples , being an entrepreneur ? How would you describe what you 're doing here ? Sheikha Lubna : Everybody laughs about the perfume . One , I think the United Arab Emirates , since inception ( it 's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed ) has always given equal opportunities for women . But it 's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push , and what it is that we can do and not do . In my personal belief you need a bridge , you need a door opener for women . And sometimes women do not want to take the risk . Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving . I had the opportunity and I had the trust from the government and the community , so to me , it is setting the example internally for the young women , and men by the way . Be it in technology , or economy or e-commerce . Defterios : And the perfume line is the exclamation point ?

As the hype for \" GTA IV \" continues to grow and reviews scream perfection , some speculate that the game will put a dent in Marvel Studios ' opening weekend box office for \" Iron Man . \" \" GTA IV \" is the ninth incarnation of a video game in which the user acts as a criminal roaming a city . The series has faced criticism for being too violent , because users are allowed to beat , stab , shoot and kill citizens and police officers . \" Iron Man \" is a movie based on the Marvel comic book superhero who creates an impressive suit of armor to save his life and help save the world . \" GTA IV", "4974": "Toussie 's father", "4975": "top floor of the building .

Her pomeranian , Minnie , has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno , California , as part of Therapy Dogs International 's \" Tail Waggin ' Tutors \" program . Minnie , who weighs in at only five pounds , sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her . \" She really does sit there and stare at them , \" says Saroyan . \" And sometimes as they 're turning the pages , she follows the page with her nose , and the kids just light up . She just knows what she 's supposed to do . \" See Minnie in action And then , of course , there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs . According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University , blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog . The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows : Dogs have been found to reduce stress . Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading . For older children and teens , the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure . Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs . \" A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely , \" she explains . \" They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [ of reading ] . ... They love it . \" It 's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it . Because they 're volunteer-based , and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level , doing a nationwide study would be difficult . However , Klotz says it 's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who do n't . She says it 's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year . She 's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year . And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids . \" It 's not just reading scores , \" she says . \" They start to speak up in class , and volunteer , and finish homework . They do n't want to miss school when they 're going to read to the dog , so it improves attendance . It kind of just flows over onto everything . \" R.E.A.D . staff and volunteers know people are skeptical about the program 's results at first , but Klotz says anyone who 's spent time with a dog will understand", "4980": "spend $ 30,000 annually to provide proper medical , educational and other assistance necessary", "4981": "make the V1 missile safe", "4982": "uncollected refuse and a lack of clean water , UNICEF said . \" Last year , we had a near collapse of basic social services , \" said Tsitsi Singizi , a spokeswoman for the organization . \" Municipal services were not providing clean water anymore and they were not collecting refuse anymore .
