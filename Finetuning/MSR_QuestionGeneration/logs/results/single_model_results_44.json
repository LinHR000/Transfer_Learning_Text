There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before.\r\n\r\nBut even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal?\r\n\r\nTo shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCNN: Has being openly gay affected your career?\r\n\r\nBatt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles \u00bb\r\n\r\nCNN: When did you come out?\r\n\r\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out].

He was captured at a hardware store.\r\n\r\nATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The trail for the convicted child molester seemed to grow cold as the police combed his empty apartment.\r\n\r\nJames Maurice Robinson, 25, a confessed sex offender, had been on the run for more than two years, and it looked as if he would elude capture yet again.\r\n\r\nThe authorities huddled in a nearby parking lot to discuss Plan B, an air of disgust hanging over them. James Ergas, the U.S. Marshal helping to lead this operation, acts on a tip. He pulls out his cell phone and calls a hardware store where the suspect may be working.\r\n\r\nUsing a ruse, he begins speaking to the manager and, at one point, Robinson himself gets on the phone and unknowingly talks to the very man trying to catch him.\r\n\r\nGotcha! Authorities now know exactly where their man is. He's seven miles away, on the other side of town. It's 11:02 a.m.\r\n\r\nErgas guns his unmarked sport utility vehicle at 95 miles per hour through downtown Atlanta, zipping in and out of the city's notorious traffic congestion.  Hear cops bang door, see raid on a home: \"Get down!\" \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"I've got no place in my heart for pedophiles,\" he says, pressing down harder on the gas.

The suspect's car, a burgundy, four-door Pontiac Grand Am, sits near a back stairwell.\r\n\r\n\"When we go in there, he's going to run out the back,\" Ergas says.\r\n\r\nHe parks near the front of the building and alerts his backup. Within minutes, the full team arrives. Two take position near the back stairwell. Ergas and other team members, dressed in black flak jackets, enter the front door at 11:19 a.m.\r\n\r\nRobinson doesn't have a chance. He tries to run, but slips. Ergas points his Taser and prepares to zap him. Robinson knows his gig is up. He surrenders peacefully.\r\n\r\n\"He saw the Taser,\" Ergas says, with a smile. \"Nobody wants to be Tased.\"\r\n\r\nMore than 100 miles away, the man who first arrested Robinson in March 2004 gets word of the capture.\r\n\r\n\"Anytime we can get a pervert off the street like that, it's going to make me happy,\" said Robert Tate, a detective with the LaFayette Police Department in northwest Georgia, near the Tennessee border.\r\n\r\nRobinson had been accused of exposing himself to a 10-year-old boy in a Wal-Mart bathroom and masturbating in front of him. Police records indicate the boy was so petrified he was afraid to leave the stall for 15 minutes afterward.\r\n\r\nRobinson pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation on May 26, 2005, according to the Walker County District Attorney's Office. But he skipped town and never made his sentencing hearing on February 14, 2006, authorities said. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. Robinson now faces five to 20 years in prison, the DA's office said.\r\n\r\nRobinson was one of 1,250 fugitives busted in Georgia last week as part of Operation Falcon", "70": "Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat, stop receiving Holy Communion because of his pro-choice politics.\r\n\r\nKennedy went public Sunday about Tobin's request, originally made in a private letter to Kennedy in 2007. Tobin responded with a statement Sunday followed by his television appearance Monday, in which he acknowledged holding Kennedy to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy.\r\n\r\nThe issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men. A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House.\r\n\r\nKennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language.\r\n\r\nRequests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion \"a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions. He acknowledged \"a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion.\"\r\n\r\nOther Catholics questioned Tobin's stance.\r\n\r\n\"The simple fact is that most bishops don't want to deny communion to politicians, and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II", "71": "texting", "72": "Johnny Carson", "73": "a-once-in-a-lifetime Leonardo da Vinci", "74": "15-year-old", "75": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Comic book fans have been waiting for years for a film to be made of \"Watchmen", "76": "estimates", "77": "racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking", "78": "just a short drive away", "79": "Spartak Moscow", "80": "Telluride", "81": "Jamarat bridge", "82": "about $163 million", "83": "non-Mexican immigrants", "84": "4 million", "85": "Seoul, South Korea", "86": "the investigation does not involve its leadership team", "87": "Coast Guard", "88": "night and cleaning office buildings", "89": "they discovered each other's true identity", "90": "Nadya Suleman has met with a ghost writer for a book", "91": "three years and seven months, Muldoon told CNN, adding that the last payment they made recently was for $1,500.\n\n\"When we mailed that last check ...

Sunday's election could be seen as a referendum on the euro-elites who so strongly opposed that war.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe conservatives who governed Spain in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the United States after the 9/11 attacks. In 2003-2004, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as George Bush's most prominent ally on the European continent. Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel.\r\r\n\r\r\nYet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels -- and staggering government deficits. The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts.\r\r\n\r\r\nZapatero slunk out of town a little while ago.

Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise,\" Obama said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. president repeated his administration's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged \"concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama's remarks, delivered from State Dining Room, were the strongest yet from the United States. \"There must be reform,\" he said, \"political, social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In the absence of these reforms,\" he said, \"grievances have built up over time.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free and more hopeful,\" he concluded.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn his remarks, Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding. And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as \"hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, \"and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption.\" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported. A CNN witness saw the building ablaze.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said the collective consequences of the government's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Within that review is military\" assistance, Gibbs said.\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The die is cast,\" said Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said, \"we've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms\" but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We don't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together,\" Gelb said, cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government.\r\r\n\r\r\nOften considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East, Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal, a strategic passageway for trade across the region.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt's government \"to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters, and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces,\" Clinton said Friday, referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"At the same time, protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"As a partner, we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately,\" Clinton said. \"They need to view civil society as their partner, not a threat.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nServers of Egypt's main internet provider were down early Friday, including servers for the Egyptian government's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarly Friday, Gibbs said that he is \"very concerned about violence in Egypt,\" tweeting that the \"government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut at least one internet service provider, Noor, was still working.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to \"defer non-essential travel to Egypt.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes,\" the agency added in a written travel alert.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times,\" the statement said, urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone.\r\r\n\r\r\nDelta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday, and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Barack Obama has requested \"multiple briefings\" on Egypt, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the target of the protesters' anger, \"but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels, including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama's messages and concerns are relayed,\" Vietor said.\r\r\n\r\r\nFormer Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak \"without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think that, if anything, one might ask why hasn't President Mubarak called President Obama and said, 'Are you with me or against me?' I mean, that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration,\" Cohen said.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances,\" he said this week.\r\r\n\r\r\nVice President Joe Biden said on \"PBS NewsHour\" on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator.\r\r\n\r\r\nStill, Biden said, \"violence isn't appropriate, and people have a right to protest.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe noted Thursday that Mubarak has been \"very helpful on a range of tough issues,\" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Wednesday, Gibbs said the U.S. administration was \"monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so, obviously, in Tunisia.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali", "161": "passive smoking, affects children.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report found that, for children", "162": "the error \"an aberration", "163": "Rohingya", "164": "10", "165": "acting chops", "166": "307", "167": "U.S. first lady Laura Bush", "168": "about 20", "169": "Bush", "170": "three years ago", "171": "disaffected", "172": "$5 million", "173": "his guilty plea", "174": "No one", "175": "US Air big DC-9 or -10", "176": "amputated", "177": "UEFA", "178": "Ben Gurion Airport", "179": "Ahmed", "180": "LOS ANGELES", "181": "JAMAICA PLAIN, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Lucy Valena is hooked on coffee", "182": "her father's home in Satsuma", "183": "February 13, 2009", "184": "pirates", "185": "war crimes", "186": "30-year rule", "187": "Greenpeace", "188": "Mirza", "189": "Sudanese", "190": "18", "191": "Hughes, 47, was unmarried with no children of his own", "192": "Sen.

Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence.\n\nThe state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors. However, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Wilson's sentence.\n\nNow 21, Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man's sentence \"constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n\nWilson said Sunday he feels no \"negative energy\" toward District Attorney David McDade, who fought efforts to have Wilson's sentence reduced.

Next to him are the bones of his 22-year-old son and the remains of another son. But no one yet knows which of the man's two missing boys the third set of remains could be.\r\n\r\nCheryl Katzmarzyk measures a leg bone as she puts together remains from Srebrenica.\r\n\r\nCheryl Katzmarzyk wants to be able to put a name to the remains, and to those of hundreds of other bodies stacked around her in a building in Lukavac, near Tuzla in the northeast of Bosnia.\r\n\r\nThe bones are from more than 8,000 men and boys slaughtered in 1995 during the Bosnian war at Srebrenica in the worst massacre in Europe since World War II.\r\n\r\nThe killers -- Serbs seeking to drive out Bosnian Muslims in a policy of \"ethnic cleansing\" -- executed the region's fighting-age males, then used bulldozers to dump them into mass graves.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the work harder for the teams trying to put the bodies back together -- so they can be returned to their families for proper burial -- is that so many have been broken up over the years.\r\n\r\nMass graves were dug up and the bodies moved sometimes again and again, to hide evidence as the Serbs retreated amid the NATO bombing that followed Srebrenica and led to the end of the war. Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites, for instance.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave. Another man's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot, one of his legs was found near a grave, a hip was found inside the grave, his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave.\r\n\r\n\"What we do here is we sort them out,\" said Katzmarzyk, the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker, simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together.  Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP's work \u00bb\r\n\r\nThen, a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives.\r\n\r\nBut DNA can only go so far, and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk's table are those of a man and his 22-year-old son, it cannot say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21-year-old or his 24-year-old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point.\r\n\r\nIt's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related. Across the room, brothers lie next to each other, but as yet the scientists do not know who is who.\r\n\r\nSo Katzmarzyk and her colleagues are also experts in forensic anthropology, using other pointers to make an identification.\r\n\r\nThey will look for clues to the age of the remains and any other factors that could identify them: Did the man break his leg as a child?

In February 2007, at 53, I started to have some health issues. At first I was unable to sleep for days. My legs started swelling. My weight started creeping up, first 5 pounds, then 10 pounds. I was lethargic and irritable. My internal clock seemed totally out of whack. I began having rushing heart palpitations every time I worked out. Okay, I've never loved daily exercise, but this was different. I actually developed a fear of working out. I was scared that I would pass out. Or worse. I felt as if I didn't know my own body anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter many trips to various doctors, I received a diagnosis. I had hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course didn't make me lose a single pound) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism (a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain). My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must \"learn to embrace hunger\" or I would immediately gain weight. Believe me, no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the struggle I'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over. I felt completely defeated.

You can't just have, let's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday or a day of service.

Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play.

The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college.

He said he spotted the pirates about three miles behind and to the right of the container ship and said Phillips \"laughed at me\" and \"ignored me completely\" when he reported the fast ship attack.\r\r\n\r\r\nPhillips disputed that account, saying he did not ignore any first warnings.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I'm not someone who laughs a lot.

She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz", "397": "Mary L.

Joseph Jackson, the patriarch, played in a short-lived band called the Falcons (no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett) in the 1950s. His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel.\r\n\r\nKatherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966.\r\n\r\nBy that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: \"He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, \"Please don't be mad at me.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson disputed the word \"beat,\" but didn't question Michael's account.\r\n\r\n\"I whipped him with a switch and a belt,\" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, \"I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick.\"\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions.\r\n\r\n\"We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,\" he said. \"I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \"chitlin circuit\" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \"the last big stars to come off my assembly line,\" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site.\r\n\r\nThe group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a collaboration,\" Gamble said. \"They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians.\"\r\n\r\nHuff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a \"fantastic meal\" cooked by Katherine Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing but respect for the father,\" added Gamble. \"He's a great man. He made something out of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nEven during that era, however, Michael was standing out.

Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses, the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers \"remained undiminished.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated,\" it says. \"Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan, along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking, have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIran is also a source of training to the Taliban \"on small-unit tactics, small arms, explosives and indirect-fire weapons,\" the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members,\" it says.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year, \"there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country, including a decrease in civilian casualties, enemy attacks, and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year,\" the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008, down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007, Travers said. He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009, although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April.\r\r\n\r\r\nAlthough the threat from al Qaeda in Iraq \"continued to diminish\" due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding, al Qaeda continued to benefit from safe haven in Somalia and has strengthened its North African operations, the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt notes a sharp increase in attacks by al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa. In Algeria, many of the attacks were blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, whose tactics \"appeared to be influenced by [al Qaeda's] experience in Iraq.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report also warns \"the security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both Western and Yemeni interests,\" culminating in the September 17 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa that killed 18.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Recruitment for al Qaeda in Yemen (AQY) remained strong, and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) and suicide vests indicated a high level of training, coordination, and sophistication by Yemen's terrorist leadership,\" the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report calls the government's response to the terrorist threat \"intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings, including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAlthough a raid in August on an al Qaeda in Yemen cell in the country uncovered large number of weapons, the report warns the action \"did little to deter or disrupt other AQY cells.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in Yemeni security-service uniforms attacked the U.S. Embassy with explosives and suicide vests, launching what the report calls a \"sophisticated and well-coordinated\" attack", "553": "cures", "554": "Monday, October 6, 2008", "555": "Crawford recommends Po Toi O a small fishing village at Clear Water Bay in the New Territories, Hong Kong", "556": "could only fix their choice on a coach of the highest standard to continue the great work already accomplished and the club's development on the playing front", "557": "Cerrie Burnell", "558": "Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi", "559": "Christian Bale", "560": "men", "561": "The Food and Drug Administration", "562": "World War II", "563": "$10 one-day fare sale", "564": "iPhone apps", "565": "2005", "566": "1,700", "567": "Chinese dairy products as the crisis which has seen more than 52,000 Chinese children poisoned by melamine-tainted goods spreads.\r\r\n\r\r\nBurundi, Gabon and Tanzania have joined governments closer to China -- including Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia -- in banning Chinese dairy products", "568": "Hudson' pilot retires", "569": "101", "570": "seriously injuring the five people on board, authorities said.\r\n\r\nA damaged airplane lies on the ground Saturday next to a busy road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThe pilot reported engine problems shortly after leaving the city's Wiley Post Airport, about a mile away from the crash site, at midmorning, said Lynn Lunsford, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.\r\n\r\nThe plane hit two trees as it came down, and video showed the damaged Beechcraft Bonanza resting on the grass near a busy thoroughfare in the northwest section of the city.\r\n\r\nFire Department Deputy Chief Cecil Clay said the two men and three women on the plane were taken to hospitals.

[We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community.\r\n\r\nCNN: And you did it by writing?\r\n\r\nAlexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years.\r\n\r\nCNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you?\r\n\r\nAlexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, \"Isn't that something?\" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's ahead of us?\r\n\r\nAlexander: Oh my goodness, so much.

Tobin responded with a statement Sunday followed by his television appearance Monday, in which he acknowledged holding Kennedy to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy.\r\n\r\nThe issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men. A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House.\r\n\r\nKennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language.\r\n\r\nRequests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion \"a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions.

The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students.\r\n\r\n\"I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,\" said Rep.

Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs.\r\n\r\nOnly five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution.\r\n\r\nSome of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions.\r\n\r\nState investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to \"shut up.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing.

In 2008, 1.5 billion adults were overweight; of this, 200 million men and about 300 million women were obese. Of the global population, 65% live in countries where being overweight kills more people than being underweight. And in 2010, nearly 43 million kids under the age of 5 were overweight.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe numbers are just as staggering for diabetes. The WHO claims that roughly 346 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. In 2004, an estimated 34 million people died as a consequence of it.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis week, the U.N. General Assembly will establish new policy resolutions that nations should adopt, with a focus on three key areas: to acknowledge the rising incidence and consequences of these health threats, to strengthen national institutional capabilities as well as policies for prevention and to foster greater international cooperation. Delegates will also discuss the creation of a U.N. monitoring framework that will track the growth of noncommunicable diseases. Nations are also expected to agree formally that by 2012, they will submit their policy recommendations and commitments to the General Assembly.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhat's the big deal about this meeting? It's a big deal because this will be only the second time that the United Nations has convened to discuss health issues. The first time was in 2001 when it addressed the HIV/AIDS crisis.\r\r\n\r\r\nIncluding a focus on obesity and diabetes is also significant because it is the first time that these health issues have reached this level of U.N. attention. Previously, obesity and diabetes were addressed only through WHO regional reports and conferences, most recently with the WHO's 2004 report \"Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health,\" which failed to garner the attention of the entire U.N. system.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe assembly meeting is also significant because, as the governing body of the World Bank and the WHO, the United Nations sends a clear message to these institutions that they need to increase their financial and technical support to combat these health threats.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut will developing nations take the new U.N. resolutions seriously? Probably not, and for several reasons.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe first simply has to do with the availability of international funding for obesity and diabetes, especially when compared with HIV/AIDS. The focus on HIV/AIDS has created an international bias in favor of committing more funding for HIV/AIDS rather than obesity and diabetes.\r\r\n\r\r\nInternational financial support for obesity and diabetes has been minimal at best. The U.N.'s International Diabetes Federation recently stated that most bilateral and multilateral funding does not provide funding for obesity, diabetes and other related noncommunicable diseases, while only 0.9% of the $22 billion spent on international health is provided for these diseases.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhat's more, the assembly's draft resolution does not make the need to raise funding for obesity, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases a priority. Also, because the resolution says nothing about creating a new Global Fund for noncommunicable diseases, there is serious doubt that increased financial support will emerge.\r\r\n\r\r\nSecond, in many developing nations, obesity and diabetes is still seen as an epidemic that mainly affects the rich. When most of the population is malnourished, politicians do not see a need to introduce new legislation for obesity and diabetes. In some nations, such as China, obesity is seen as a sign of good fortune. But ignoring the diseases will contribute to high health care costs, especially as nations strive for universal coverage and as the rich and middle classes grow.\r\r\n\r\r\nFinally, developing nations are unlikely to respond to new resolutions because there is little civil societal pressures to do so. In most nations, no proactive, well-organized civic movement has emerged in response to obesity and diabetes. While some exceptions exist, such as India's All India Association for Advancing Research in Obesity and China's Chinese Diabetes Society, they lack adequate funding, domestic and international support.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.N. meeting this week will certainly raise a lot of eyebrows and draw attention", "1224": "Illinois", "1225": "5:30 a.m.", "1226": "Kate Gosselin", "1227": "Mukhtar Ahmad", "1228": "Kapoor and Eroshevich", "1229": "White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced that Obama", "1230": "new Comedy Central show.\r\n\r\nYou can hear it in the comedian's deadpan delivery, which makes some of his serious musings sound like jokes -- and some of his jokes sound like serious philosophizing.

Military commanders urged him to fight the release of the photos, fearing it would endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe photographs first appeared in a report on \"60 Minutes 2\" in late April 2004, followed by an extensive story on the abuse by award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker.\r\n\r\n\"It was a big shock,\" said Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, the head of the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television station. \"It hurt mostly the ones who were for the fall of the Saddam [Hussein] regime. ...

See Bush administration interrogation tactics \u00bb\r\n\r\nA CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll immediately after the photos were released showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans said the mistreatment of the detainees was unjustified under any circumstances.

The poll also showed support for the war at its lowest since before it began, with only 44 percent saying they believed it was worthwhile.  See some of the disturbing photos (discretion advised) \u00bb\r\n\r\nIt was a blow from which the administration, especially then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, never fully recovered. Amanpour said Obama's presidential victory and big wins by Democrats in the House and Senate were proof of that.\r\n\r\n\"The American people said that they wanted their good name, the name of their country, the influence and credibility of their country's standing, to be restored in the rest of the world,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe photos did what a print report could not do. They showed front-and-center what human rights groups had been saying for months: that the Bush administration was abusing prisoners within U.S. custody. Some photos showed naked prisoners piled on top of each other like a pyramid. Another showed a smiling female U.S. soldier giving a thumbs-up next to a naked, hooded prisoner.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the furor unleashed by the pictures, 11 American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses, and some officers were reprimanded.\r\n\r\nAl-Rashed said he had expected violations in war, but nothing like \"humiliating individuals in those kinds of scenes.\" The Middle East has a \"bloody, long, bad record about torture of prisoners,\" he said, but what happened at Abu Ghraib was even more reprehensible because it undercut America's democratic values.\r\n\r\n\"You talk about democracy, you talk about the respect of individuality, the freedom. ... The prison pictures just really made us speechless.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was something completely new -- something that we had not seen before in all the dictionary of prisoners and torture and mistreatment. It just weakened the argument completely about the wisdom of getting rid of a regime like Saddam.

I want to stay here because I enjoy it so much.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nLast year, he and his family and friends saved his home from the record flooding that nearly ravaged the entire city -- but it took 30,000 sand bags.\r\r\n\r\r\nA farm boy since birth, Paulson said the sandbagging in 2009 saved his property from major damage, meaning another pleasant year of watching the wildlife in his backyard.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I can see turkeys and squirrels and deer. They come up at night.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut when the retired sporting goods store manager looks down the street now, what he sees is a mix of houses on stilts ready to be moved and vacant houses awaiting demolition.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe neighbors in the 14 houses to his south and three to the north sold their homes to the city, accepting its offer to buy them out so that a more permanent levee can be built up in their place.\r\r\n\r\r\nPaulson says he's surprised that so many people made the decision, since some had \"beautiful homes.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe buyouts were voluntary, but since Paulson decided to stay, he must foot the bill for his portion of that new levee himself. He hasn't received a bill yet, but he says whatever the cost, it should be worth it because that mountain of dirt will mean his days of sandbagging are over.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince the city's new levee isn't up yet, earthen levees surrounding Paulson's home are protecting it from this year's flood.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The cupboards are all stocked up, the freezer is all stocked up, so I can stay here for weeks without having to go out,\" Paulson said, laughing.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd those levees will protect him up to a 43-foot crest. The most recent forecast calls for a crest of 38 feet, so Paulson says he's \"not worried at all\" about staying in his home while the water is high.\r\r\n\r\r\nHis wife of 57 years died shortly after the flood of 2009.

But few dispute that the uprising launched on January 25 has changed an ancient nation in a fundamental way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I am optimistic about the future.

It's changed the relationship between sons and fathers and fathers and daughters.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests lasted 18 days, growing despite clashes with police and pro-Mubarak gangs. The armed forces refused to intercede on Mubarak's behalf, and he handed over power to a council of generals on February 11.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe generals suspended Egypt's constitution and named a civilian caretaker government, but remain the final authority in Cairo.

Any evaluation now is premature.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nWith liberals, nationalists, leftists and Islamists now split over whether elections or constitutional reforms should come first, Gerges said the protesters are realizing an old lesson: \"Revolutions are messy.\" But those debates are \"a healthy sign that civil society is still alive.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My worry is the cleavages are much deeper than we think, and the question is, will there be a government that will be able to govern in the next two or three years?\" Gerges said. \"If you don't have a consensus on what the future is, you won't be able to govern.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nJumana Shehata, a former media consultant at the National Council for Human Rights, has been critical of the path the revolution has taken. She said secular political parties need more time to organize as a counterweight to the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Right now, the Muslim Brotherhood is the only strong party, and we need more diversity,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Gerges said the Brotherhood has its own divisions, with younger members \"closer to the nationalists and the liberals and the leftists than the old guard.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe military's decision recent decision to delay parliamentary elections until November is a concession to the secular groups, said Shadi Hamid, an analyst at the Qatar-based branch of the Brookings Institution. Hamid said that vote \"will clarify matters,\" demonstrating which of the competing factions \"have the support and capability to push things forward and challenge the military's hold on power.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nShehata took part in the January protests at Tahrir Square and said most Egyptians still support the revolution, but are \"fed up\" with the new demonstrations.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I understand the chaos after a revolution, but I don't see the people in Tahrir now as revolutionaries,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Hamid called the renewed protests a \"frightening turn\" in post-revolutionary Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"More and more, the military staff is being portrayed as an enemy of democracy and an enemy of the transition, at least among the people in Tahrir Square,\" Hamid said. Neither side appears willing to back down, \"and it increasingly looks like the interests of both sides are in some ways impossible to reconcile.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt's military has been the backbone of the state since 1952, when Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser led a coup that toppled the country's monarchy -- and the generals will likely try to keep much of that influence in any new government, said Nathan Brown, a Middle East analyst at George Washington University.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There's no question the military does not want to be responsible for collecting the trash and running the schools and the health-care system and the economy, which is a mess,\" Brown told CNN. \"They don't want civilian oversight when they do go back to the barracks, and they don't want to lose a privileged position in Egyptian political and social life.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut that sort of privilege may be harder to come by in the new Egypt. During the March referendum on changes to the country's constitution, Brown said, newspapers carried stories about VIPs who showed up at polling places where long lines had formed, expecting to be allowed to vote ahead of the hoi polloi.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Every time this happened, they were told, 'Wait a minute, this is a different country now.

But coaches also need to make sure they make the best decisions for their athletes.\r\n\r\nThat requires a broad range of skills, from understanding the athlete experience and identifying particular challenges they may encounter as well as having a firm understanding of where funding comes from and making sure it's spent wisely\r\n\r\n\"We prepare our athletes to be the best in the world.

Its core World Class Sport Coach Development program is endorsed by the British Olympic Association.\r\n\r\nThe course is made up of 10 one-day master classes that are spread out over a period of about 10 months. In a typical meeting, coaches are given scenarios, break up into groups for discussion and then present their responses to the class.\r\n\r\nThe program is flexible so coaches can focus on the skills they want to improve. A wide range of topics are covered, from communication, negotiation and team building skills to body language, motivation and development of young players.\r\n\r\nNeal estimates that about 160 coaches have completed the coaching program since it was launched. Most participants are UK-based, but coaches come from around the world and represent a long list of sports that includes diving, swimming, rugby, hockey, shooting and cricket.\r\n\r\nCoaches have few opportunities to share their knowledge. According to Neal, that's one reason why the course has been popular. One measure of its success: Many coaches, like Vaughan-Ellis, participate more than once.\r\n\r\nDue to a lack of funding, however, coaches oftentimes end up paying for the course themselves. Ashridge heavily subsidizes the program and charges \u00a32,000, just about a quarter of what it actually costs to run it.\r\n\r\nBut in return, the business school gets a unique perspective on decision making that is fed back into its executive education programs, Neal said.\r\n\r\nElite coaches have a lot to offer companies, especially in the current economic downturn, Neal said. More businesses are under pressure to maximize efficiency, and many want to learn from the sport experience, since coaches are required to achieve results quickly.\r\n\r\nWith 2012 less than three years away, Vaughan-Ellis is planning to return to Ashridge for a refresher", "1907": "Nairobi", "1908": "155", "1909": "two", "1910": "Filicia", "1911": "10th", "1912": "Egypt", "1913": "Blackwater", "1914": "SEGA Pass service was momentarily down", "1915": "19", "1916": "Moe", "1917": "David Wilhelm, a federal customs agent", "1918": "deliberate and repeated research misconduct", "1919": "Bachelet last week", "1920": "civil or criminal laws", "1921": "The association", "1922": "23-year-old", "1923": "two car bombs", "1924": "one soldier", "1925": "the practices", "1926": "China, Serbia (including Kosovo), Russia, Nigeria, Mexico, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Sri Lanka", "1927": "Olympic Games", "1928": "Barack Obama", "1929": "seven", "1930": "Sheriff Thomas J", "1931": "13 of the 36 years", "1932": "two cakes at a time.

His paintings are large and uncompromising, stunning in texture, original in design. He's got the real thing. He's got \"it,\" just as she had. But what if he also has something else, like the APOE-e4 gene, known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's? What if he is in line to inherit this devastating disease?\r\n\r\nWhat I could barely endure happening to my mother, I know I could not possibly endure happening to my son. So, like my friend Karen, I embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for Alzheimer's disease. Anything short of that is too risky.\r\n\r\nKaren is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective, widely available interventions. She compares Alzheimer's disease prevention to the polio vaccine: \"Had a vaccine not been developed for polio, hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe. Similarly, not only is treatment of Alzheimer's likely to be less effective than prevention, it's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive,\" she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine.\r\n\r\nKaren and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility: a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\nSo what's the holdup? Well, money, of course, and attitude, perhaps. Finding a treatment within the next 10 years that will prevent Alzheimer's disease will require a major national investment to bring together the scientists to develop an effective, safe and affordable way to block the disease.\r\n\r\nAccording to Harry Johns, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association, \"No other disease causes so much suffering, is so certainly fatal, affects so many and drives so much cost with so little spent to overcome it.\" Why is that? Johns names ignorance, age discrimination, stigma and denial as likely explanations.\r\n\r\nMy plea is deeply personal, but by 2050, Alzheimer", "2041": "first", "2042": "thousands of tons", "2043": "explicit warnings", "2044": "vying for the Democratic presidential nomination this year", "2045": "Silverstone's comeback took place despite rival track Donington Park", "2046": "PARIS", "2047": "John Yettaw", "2048": "40 million", "2049": "the families, Calderon and local political and civic leaders", "2050": "Friday.\r\n\r\nThe new charges caused another delay in the murder case, CNN afiliate KRON reported.\r\n\r\nThe complaint charged that Huckaby \"did willfully and unlawfully mingle a harmful substance with food or drink\" with the intent to harm the child, identified only as \"Jane M.

Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.

If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months.\r\n\r\nThere has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch.\r\n\r\nIf a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite.\r\n\r\n\"If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,\" said Steve Goldstein", "2079": "231 million percent", "2080": "it is now safe to drink in a Baltimore suburb where a huge water main burst", "2081": "Pedro Noguera", "2082": "Midfielder Simone Pepe netted the only goal from close range in the 34th minute after a cross by striker Alessandro Matri.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt put the Turin", "2083": "administration's decision", "2084": "some calls, and I'm sure starting to learn the limits of movement", "2085": "the NCAA", "2086": "conquering the demons", "2087": "$37,500", "2088": "gold standard of green machines", "2089": "CNN)  -- A 23-year-old", "2090": "adultery", "2091": "Medicare", "2092": "Olten's age", "2093": "Mauricio Funes", "2094": "former Boy Scout", "2095": "the end of the practice of releasing non-Mexican immigrants", "2096": "sea gulls", "2097": "Gaza City.\r\n\r\nDays passed fast.

I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi.\r\n\r\nI trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.\r\n\r\nBy mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way.\r\n\r\nFinally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel.

And Canadians asked themselves: What next?\r\r\n\r\r\nLeMay Doan got her chance to light the caldron after all. As the mime raised the stubborn leg during the closing ceremonies, LeMay Doan came out beaming with her torch.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe wasn't the only Canadian beaming Sunday. Despite a slow first week on the tracks, rinks and courses of the games, the home team became a story of resiliency and national pride.\r\r\n\r\r\nJoannie Rochette, who lost her beloved mother to a heart attack two days before she was to compete in the first night of figure skating, was chosen as the Canadian flag bearer for the closing ceremonies. The 24-year-old skater will long be remembered as the symbol of these games for her strength in a time of personal crisis.\r\r\n\r\r\nRochette skated flawlessly in that first night of the competition, then dazzled the crowd in the free skate, winning the bronze medal, the hearts of a nation and the respect of those watching around the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nYears from now, they will talk of her strength and her bravery, but she just saw herself as the daughter who shared a dream with a mother who wouldn't let her fail.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe wasn't perfect in her performance, but in an imperfect games, she was a beacon of all that is right about sports.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe head of the host organization said his nation was proud of the way it had revealed itself to each other and to the world.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I believe we Canadians tonight are stronger, more united, more in love with our country and more connected with each other than ever before,\" John Furlong, chief executive officer of VANOC, said. \"These Olympic Games have lifted us up. If the Canada that came together on opening night was a little mysterious, it no longer is. Now you know us, eh?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nWatch Canadian fans celebrate in the streets\r\r\n\r\r\nThe rest of the closing ceremony became a lighthearted tribute to Canada, featuring comedians and some of its most famous singers, like Neil Young, Michael Buble and Alanis Morissette.\r\r\n\r\r\nThese Olympics needed saving. Even as thousands of fans and reporters were arriving the first week, it almost seemed as if the games were a national embarrassment.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe problems actually started a month before the Olympics opened, as Vancouver went through the warmest January in history. The well-above-freezing temperatures caused some observers to call these the Spring Olympics.\r\r\n\r\r\nVancouver Organizing Committee officials said that while it wasn't the weather they expected when they won the bid for the games in 2003, it really wouldn't prevent the outdoor events from taking place.\r\r\n\r\r\nDuring those first rough days, Canadian officials tried to reassure the nation and the world that the host country would do well on medals, and that they had planned for weather pitfalls.\r\r\n\r\r\nWith the Winter Games closing Sunday night, you could almost hear the voices of Canadian officials saying, \"We told you everything would work out.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt was on the slopes of Whistler Creekside where two of the most compelling stories of these Winter Olympics unfolded.\r\r\n\r\r\nOne belonged to Lindsey Vonn, the U.S. skier who had dominated the World Cup. She was a medal favorite in four of the five Olympic events she entered, but on the eve of the games, she suffered a major shin injury. The weather delays gave her more time to heal. She won two medals, a gold in the downhill and a bronze in the Super G, but crashed in her other three events.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum was former bad boy Bode Miller, who made more news partying at the 2006 Olympics than he did on the slopes. But 2010 will be remembered for how he redeemed himself by skiing to three medals, including a gold in the super combined. He became the most decorated U.S. Alpine skier in history.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpeed skater Apolo Anton Ohno also wrote himself into the U.S. medals record book with a silver in the 1,500 meters short track final, a bronze in the 1,000 meters and a bronze in the relay.

I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead.\r\n\r\nThe rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition.\r\n\r\nThen there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards.\r\n\r\nThe story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging.\r\n\r\nUltimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\"\r\n\r\nSorry, Rick, I disagree.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control.\r\n\r\nRunning with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion.

They've built a small, not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis prestige over practicality issue something of a recurring theme in Dubai's banner building projects.\r\n\r\nKrane, who lived and worked in Dubai from 2005 to 2007, also called into questions the attraction of the Palm Islands.

Andres Granier's office told CNN.\n\nAbout 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported.\n\nOne death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that thousands of people clung to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hunkered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years.\n\nWeather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days.

Thursday's report said the Davis case exposed the deep concerns over the death penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972, when the (Supreme) Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases,\" the report said.\r\r\n\r\r\nA CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in October found that for the first time in recent memory, more Americans favor a sentence of life in prison over the death penalty for murderers -- 50% to 48%.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat's not to say that Americans want to abolish the death penalty entirely.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther polls have shown majorities generally favor it, but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said his analysis shows there is a difference between thinking the government should have the death penalty as an option and actually wanting to see it applied.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe decline in the number who prefer the death penalty as the punishment for murder may be related to the growing number who believe that at least one person in the past five years has been executed for a crime that he or she did not commit.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 2005, when a solid majority preferred the death penalty, 59% believed that an innocent person had been executed within the previous five years. Now that figure has risen dramatically, to 72%.\r\r\n\r\r\nDavis drew widespread support for his claims that an innocent man was being put to death, after federal and state courts had rejected his calls for a new trial.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince Davis' conviction in 1991, seven of the nine witnesses against him recanted their testimony, and no physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of a Savannah police officer. However, a federal judge concluded the death row inmate \"vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nA Texas execution in July also attracted international attention. Mexican national Humberto Leal Garcia was convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl. A world court found the state violated his rights by not giving Leal access to his home country's consulate upon his arrest in 1994, as required by an international treaty. U.S. and Mexican officials, along with a variety of human rights groups, urged Texas to delay the execution, but to no avail.\r\r\n\r\r\nTexas continues to lead the nation as the busiest death penalty state, with 13 executions this year. Alabama was next with six, and Ohio with five. No more are scheduled until next month.\r\r\n\r\r\nThirty-four states have capital laws, but only 13 states carried out that ultimate punishment in 2011. In addition, several states with capital punishment laws did not sentence anyone to death in 2011, including Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and South Carolina.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnother high-profile murder convict in Pennsylvania saw his death sentence commuted. Prosecutors decided this month not to give Mumia Abu-Jamal a new capital sentencing hearing. He was convicted of murdering Philadelphia police office Daniel Faulkner, but has long claimed his innocence as a victim of what he called a racist criminal justice system.

A series of exercises, lectures, and meditations stretched over 10 months, Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people's lives.\r\n\r\nLike some participants, Joan, who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at Spirit Rock, initially balked at the idea of singing. \"I thought James wanted me to join a choir,\" she says, \"but I took it on faith that the singing was going to work.\" So she started trilling along with the \"Hairspray\" soundtrack while driving. \"It seemed ridiculous, but that's what initially helped me the most.\"\r\n\r\n\"The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being,\" says Baraz. \"In other words, it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good.\" The first and most important step, he says, is intention: making the decision to be happy.\r\n\r\nRobert Holden, Ph.D., author of \"Happiness Now! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast\" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. \"Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow. For centuries, optimists and pessimists have argued over who's right, and the answer is they both are; each sees what they're looking for. If you focus on happiness, that's what you become more aware of.\"\r\n\r\nOnce participants have made up their minds to be happier, Baraz gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in Berkeley and in twice-monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind. Among them:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Writing what the word joy means to you\r\n\r\n\u2022 Doing some form of physical movement -- such as yoga, dance, or walking -- a few times a week\r\n\r\n\u2022 Making a \"nourishment list\" of activities you enjoy, checking off those you do regularly and circling the ones that could be done more often\r\n\r\n\u2022 Checking in with your \"joy buddy,\" a kind of running partner in the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\n\"That's important,\" says Holden. \"One of the major blocks to happiness is a sense of isolation. If you're alive, you need help.\"\r\n\r\nThere are also guided meditations, including instructions on how to be mindful --being present for whatever you're doing and, as Baraz says, \"simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different.\"\r\n\r\nFor Joan, that turned out to be a bigger challenge than singing -- especially when her husband suggested that they begin the separation process.\r\n\r\n\"Awakening Joy isn't about being a happy little do bee,\" she says. \"You're taught that when feelings arise, no matter what they are, you stay with them.

But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call.

When I first went to the big city, there was so [much] pollution and so [it] always makes me feel bad. I also don't like the smell.\"\r\n\r\nHer new life in China began after the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled last year that Anna should be returned to her biological parents, Jack and Casey He, known in China as He Shaoqiang and Qin Luo respectively.\r\n\r\nThe decision ended a six-year custody battle.\r\n\r\nAnna was born prematurely while her parents were in Memphis, Tennessee, on temporary work visas. Unable to cope financially, they decided to give her up temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\r\n\r\nThat's when Jerry and Louise Baker stepped in and agreed to take temporary custody of Anna, when she was 4 weeks old. The Bakers said they made a verbal agreement with the Hes to take care of Anna until she was 18.\r\n\r\nBut the Hes dispute that. They wanted their daughter back soon after her first birthday and eventually went to court to have their parental rights restored. After a bitter legal battle, the Hes finally prevailed and Anna was returned to her parents. Anna was given a six-month transition period to adjust to her biological family before the Hes left the United States.\r\n\r\nNow back in China, Anna is still finding it hard to adjust. Her biological parents have separated since returning to their homeland. Casey He relocated her family from Changsha, China, to Chongqing -- a sprawling mega-city on the banks of the Yangtze River with a population of 32 million. Like most of China's big cities, it's heavily polluted. During the winter, the sun rarely breaks through the heavy brown smog.\r\n\r\nJack He says the marriage is over. Casey He appears shaken when asked about her husband and why she packed up and left, with Anna and her younger brother and sister -- Andy, 8, and Avita, 6.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of things were not what I intended and not what I had hoped,\" said Casey He. She said she would talk about why she left \"one day when the kids are bigger.\"\r\n\r\nJack He says the couple disagreed over how they should raise their children. He has limited contact with his family; Anna has seen him only once in the past two months but says she doesn't miss him. Asked why, she said, \"I don't know. It's just a feeling in me.\"\r\n\r\nNow a single mother, Casey has enrolled all three children in a boarding school during the week. A tough decision, she says, but necessary -- especially for Anna, who was a straight-A student in the U.S. but now struggles because she can't speak Chinese.\r\n\r\n\"I know American people say I am bad, I take the kids to school, this is not good. But in China, the Chinese people don't think so. They study very hard,\" Casey He said.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her children in a small, two-bedroom apartment; it's clean and sparsely furnished. Casey bought a new piano for Anna and Avita, who are both taking lessons.\r\n\r\nThe apartment and school are both paid for by Casey He's brother, a wealthy businessman.\r\n\r\nLife is difficult, she says, but she has no doubt that despite Anna's struggle to fit in, the little girl is still better off with her in China rather than living in Memphis with the Bakers.\r\n\r\n\"In China one single mother take three kids -- for me, it is very hard.

A handful of states and cities including Minnesota, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, have passed laws in some form banning BPA in products meant for children.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position is a partial reversal of the FDA's declaration in 2008 that BPA has no adverse effects. That announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry-funded research.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince then, the agency says on its Web site, \"recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals. While BPA is not proven to harm children or adults, these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of BPA.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program, which in its own 2008 report said there is \"some concern\" for BPA's effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. Other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the authors of those studies say it's not clear the problems were actually caused by BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt a news conference Friday, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said further research is needed \"to determine if and when further action is needed.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has been allotted $30 million to study the health effects of BPA.

F--- them,\" she allegedly said as her husband, Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, bandied about a scheme to withhold state funds from the Cubs' parent Tribune Company unless the owner agreed to fire certain Chicago Tribune employees.\n\nSeven days later, according to the affidavit, she took part in a meeting about whether President-elect Barack Obama would secure a lucrative job for her if her husband appointed Obama's preferred candidate to his vacant Senate seat.\n\nU.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has said Patricia Blagojevich is not the target of the investigation of the governor's alleged attempts to sell Obama's Senate seat, pressure the Chicago Tribune and threaten to withdraw funding from a children's hospital.  Watch what prosecutors say was the first lady's role in alleged scandal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nA glance at her profile on the governor's Web site details a list of philanthropic endeavors, including awareness campaigns for breast cancer, heart disease and food allergies. She also has championed children's health care and literacy, and has parlayed her love for gardening into the State Beautification Initiative.\n\n\"As first lady, she works hard to promote initiatives that will help the families of Illinois bring up happy, healthy and successful children,\" her biography says.\n\nBlagojevich and her family have been part of the Chicago machine for decades. The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko", "3232": "October 1991", "3233": "2002", "3234": "12,000", "3235": "shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for \"e-waste\" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nSome of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 a Greenpeace study, \"Not in My Backyard\", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\r\n\r\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\r\n\r\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\r\n\r\nIt's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading.\r\n\r\nThe volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste.\r\n\r\nEach one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years.\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market.\r\n\r\n\"Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,\" said Schoppink.\r\n\r\n\"It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU", "3236": "chase happiness", "3237": "global slump in property prices", "3238": "Belarus", "3239": "Baytown and Beaumont, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Torrance, California", "3240": "political foe", "3241": "fortune and glory", "3242": "Thursday", "3243": "Gotti", "3244": "albatross chicks", "3245": "U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan", "3246": "More than 600", "3247": "CNN) -- A conservative billionaire businessman and a former center-left president", "3248": "Walger", "3249": "has reportedly been dating a 20-year-old Russian cocktail waitress, Ekaterina Ivanova, for a year.", "3250": "Energy companies", "3251": "growing roster of people seeking asylum in an industrialized nation", "3252": "nearly 200,000", "3253": "old Hollywood?

Once you've got your bike, you're ready to career around the cobbled streets of Montmartre and rattle along the Seine.\r\n\r\nCaf\u00e9 hotspots The classic Parisian image of smoky cafes is now banished to the pavements, thanks to a smoking ban in bars and restaurants that came in at the end of 2007. Quel dommage! In the winter, caf\u00e9 culture's hotspots are those with heated terraces. You'll still be able to light up while you sip a petit caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me, but only if you sit outside -- bring a turtleneck and a beret to keep you warm as well as stylish.\r\n\r\nMassages at the Mosque Paris is home to a large Muslim population, and La Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Paris (rue Geoffroy St. Hilaire.) reflects that.

Evidence of the dangers of smoking, coupled with smoking bans and steep tobacco taxes, has cut the smoking rate in half for the overall U.S. population over the past 50 years. Now, it is widely acknowledged that smoking is largely isolated in vulnerable populations.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhy don't Medicaid smokers quit in response to policies that are effective for others? One reason is that investing in preventive health care is difficult when you live month-to-month. But an indulgence the poor really can't afford is cigarettes. Smoking is expensive. A pack-a-day smoker could save more than $2,000 per year by quitting.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow would the proposed incentive system work? Smokers on Medicaid would receive small payments in return for quitting or getting cessation counseling as a step toward quitting. Participants would have to hold up their end of the bargain. They would get paid only if medical claims data indicated that they were getting counseling or they tested to be smoke-free. Tests can easily be conducted using breathalyzers to measure carbon monoxide levels.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt may seem implausible that such a limited compensation could push anyone to quit a practice as addictive as cigarette smoking, but there is solid evidence that it works. Research on addiction has repeatedly demonstrated that small payments have persuaded even cocaine addicts to stop using. Furthermore, in my research, I have found that the financial motivation to quit is more effective for low-income smokers than a motivation based on health concerns.\r\r\n\r\r\nSmall payments can be effective by providing tangible, immediate and clear-cut gains.\r\r\n\r\r\nTaxpayers would have a lot to gain from this approach, too. Medical care for tobacco-related diseases costs Medicaid an estimated $22 billion every year. Treating the many illnesses associated with smoking -- emphysema, coronary heart disease and lung cancer, to name a few -- is expensive. Pregnant smokers risk premature childbirth and often expensive medical treatment for their newborns.\r\r\n\r\r\nSensible as they are, incentive payments to smokers on Medicaid face many obstacles before they can be adopted by the federal government.\r\r\n\r\r\nMany people, including politicians, will chafe at paying people to do something they ought to do on their own. Smoking carries the taint of a moral vice, a bad habit that should require no incentive to abandon.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut providing incentives to promote positive behaviors is a common practice and often uncontroversial. Employers and life insurers, for example, increasingly provide financial incentives to stop smoking. They consider these incentives good investments. Paying such incentives could both improve health for the poor and lower Medicaid costs for taxpayers.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnother obstacle to implementation is a lack of research on how best to design such a program for low-income populations. While in previous studies of heroin users I found that paying higher incentive payments is both more powerful and more cost-effective, we do not know the best level of payments for Medicaid smokers. Also we do not know whether it would be better to pay for using the counseling or only for actually stopping smoking, or a mix.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe are getting closer to answering these important questions.

Watch Zeynep Fadilioglu show off her work and inspirations \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe shores of the Bosporus Strait are studded with 16th century masterpieces such as the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by the Ottoman Empire's most famous architect, Mimar Sinan, and ornate, neo-Baroque jewels designed by the Armenian Balyan family in the 19th century. But Istanbul's most senior Muslim cleric laments that mosque design suffered a decline after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I.\r\n\r\n\"In the last 70, 80 years, we have built mosques that are copies of Ottoman architecture,\" said Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul. \"This wasn't a good development, because the copy can never be as good as the original.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu and her team of artists are hoping to change that.  Look at photos of the mosque \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe Sakirin Mosque was commissioned by a wealthy Turkish Arab family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe designers put a number of contemporary touches on the structure, giving it plate glass walls etched with gold-leaf verses from the Quran, framed by giant cast-iron grids.\r\n\r\nThe mihrab -- the alcove that points worshippers in the direction of Mecca -- is made of asymmetrical ovals, similar to a design used by Fadillioglu to decorate a restaurant in London. And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops.\r\n\r\n\"The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,\" Fadillioglu explained. \"So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the artists here never worked on a mosque before.\r\n\r\n\"It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,\" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. \"If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area. Sort of as if (they are) unwanted in the mosque,\" she said. \"That is not what Islam is about. ... Women are equal in Islam to men\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes' drive from the Sakirin Mosque stands the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, a 16th century structure built by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in honor of his favorite daughter.

Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast\" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. \"Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow.

And McLaren faces further penalties when the WMSC reconvenes in December 2007. McLaren must submit a full technical report on its 2008 car. If the WMSC considers that its design was influenced by confidential Ferrari data, then sanctions may be imposed on the team for the 2008 season.\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren team chief Ron Dennis arrives for the hearing in Paris.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn an official press statement, the FIA stated: \"The WMSC has stripped Vodafone McLaren Mercedes of all constructor points in the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship and the team can score no points for the remainder of the season.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Furthermore, the team will pay a fine equal to $100m, less the FOM [Formula One Management] income lost as a result of the points deduction.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"However, due to the exceptional circumstances in which the FIA gave the team's drivers an immunity in return for providing evidence, there is no penalty in regard to drivers' points.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nShould McLaren's drivers, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton, win in any of the remaining races of the 2007 season no representatives of McLaren will be allowed on the podium.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe WMSC is expected to announce the reasons for its decisions on September 14.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn July the WMSC ruled that McLaren was in breach of Article 151c of the FIA International Sporting Code but recommended that no punitive measures were taken until a hearing of the FIA's International Court of Appeal on September 13. However, in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe murky story began in June of this year, when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena, Italy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren's chief designer Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan's wife, Trudy Coughlan, had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren's Woking headquarters. An employee of the copy shop, suspicious that confidential data was being copied, blew the whistle to Ferrari.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney, a friend and former colleague of Coughlan's (the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s). Stepney had been the team's chief mechanic, but in February took his new role as the team's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena, Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari issued the following press statement:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal, concerning the theft of technical information. Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut now the FIA is in possession of new evidence. Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso. On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa, Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated: \"The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession, or that such drivers have recently been in possession, of written evidence relevant to this investigation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe letter continued: \"I can confirm, given the importance of this issue, that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the International Sporting Code or the Formula One regulations. However, in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information, serious consequences could follow.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFive days later the WMSC announced it was to reconvene \"following the emergence of new evidence\", in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa in practice leading up to the Monaco Grand Prix. Stepney has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther drama overshadowed Alonso and Hamilton's one-two on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. Modena's public prosecutor, Giuseppe Tibis, issued a legal notice -- known as an 'avviso di garanzia' -- that six McLaren employees were under criminal investigation . The six included McLaren supremo Ron Dennis, managing directors Martin Whitmarsh and Jonathan Neale, technical director Jonathan Neale and designer Rob Taylor as well as Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis outcome has put a dark shadow McLaren's return to winning ways. The team, dominant in the late 1990s, had struggled with reliability for some years. But the team is not taking the decision lying down.

Rod Blagojevich, bandied about a scheme to withhold state funds from the Cubs' parent Tribune Company unless the owner agreed to fire certain Chicago Tribune employees.\n\nSeven days later, according to the affidavit, she took part in a meeting about whether President-elect Barack Obama would secure a lucrative job for her if her husband appointed Obama's preferred candidate to his vacant Senate seat.\n\nU.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has said Patricia Blagojevich is not the target of the investigation of the governor's alleged attempts to sell Obama's Senate seat, pressure the Chicago Tribune and threaten to withdraw funding from a children's hospital.  Watch what prosecutors say was the first lady's role in alleged scandal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nA glance at her profile on the governor's Web site details a list of philanthropic endeavors, including awareness campaigns for breast cancer, heart disease and food allergies. She also has championed children's health care and literacy, and has parlayed her love for gardening into the State Beautification Initiative.\n\n\"As first lady, she works hard to promote initiatives that will help the families of Illinois bring up happy, healthy and successful children,\" her biography says.\n\nBlagojevich and her family have been part of the Chicago machine for decades. The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko.\n\nRezko, who was convicted in the summer on 16 counts, including fraud, money laundering and abetting bribery, is part of this week's allegations against Rod Blagojevich. Federal authorities allege Rezko is one of the conspirators with whom the governor schemed in what Fitzgerald called \"a corruption crime spree.\"\n\nThe first lady, a licensed real estate broker and appraiser with an economics degree from the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, has not been charged with wrongdoing.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich's ties to Rezko came under fire after the Chicago Tribune in 2005 reported that 25 percent of her income in 2004 -- about $38,000 -- came via deals with Rezko, one of the governor's top fundraisers at the time. Aides to the governor said there was nothing nefarious about the business relationship.\n\nIn October, the Chicago Tribune reported that the first lady's home-based real estate firm, River Realty, had received about $700,000 in commissions since 2000, when Blagojevich began raising funds for his gubernatorial run. Of those commissions, the paper reported, about three-quarters came from \"state contractors, family and others with political ties.\"\n\nAmong her associates, the Tribune reported, were William Cellini, a key player in the Rezko trial, and Anita Mahajan, who was charged in 2007 with bilking Illinois out of more than $2 million for drug-screening services her firm never performed. The paper reported that Mahajan's husband, Amrish, was a former Blagojevich fundraiser.\n\nDespite the reported income, the federal affidavit outlining the charges against Rod Blagojevich states the governor was bemoaning his family's \"financial stress\" and expressing hope that Obama might help alleviate it.\n\nA six-figure salary for serving on a corporate or nonprofit board would help the \"struggling\" family, he allegedly said, noting that Patricia Blagojevich's Series 7 license to sell securities", "4121": "volunteer firefighters", "4122": "40.82 feet", "4123": "boost the leadership and management skills of coaches", "4124": "an SUV swerved to avoid a spool of wire", "4125": "U.S. Navy SEAL commandos, Phillips was lauded as a hero, and the publisher of his new book promoted him as a sea captain who risked his life by offering himself as a hostage \"in exchange for the safety of the crew.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe 16 crew members have been far less public about the events, even as Phillips toured the country this spring to promote his book, \"A Captain's Duty.\" But now they are telling a different version of what took place in the waters off the Somali coast in early April 2009.\r\r\n\r\r\nPerry, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Navy, was the chief engineer aboard the Alabama as it sailed from Oman, in the Persian Gulf, to Mombasa, Kenya, with a cargo of relief supplies. He told CNN Correspondent Drew Griffin that Phillips' decision \"certainly warrants an investigation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I just want an investigation, for this to be looked at properly before that man winds up going back to sea on another ship and endangering somebody,\" Perry said.\r\r\n\r\r\nPerry said he sailed on the Alabama after the pirate incident and retrieved e-mail warnings -- seven in all -- that urged the Alabama and other ships in the area to stay clear of the Somali coast and sail 600 miles away if necessary to avoid pirate attacks.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnother former crew member, third", "4126": "Sunday night", "4127": "Khamenei", "4128": "Passive Millimeter Wave", "4129": "Sinan", "4130": "Colin Powell: I really don't know that I know the answer to that question.

You can't just have, let's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday or a day of service. We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year.\r\n\r\nWe need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ...

Otherwise, these kids will find bad adults to copy from, and we're going to lose them.\r\n\r\nLemon: I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me.\r\n\r\nLemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort?\r\n\r\nPowell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe've got to teach them that you've got to behave. You've got to learn what it means to \"mind\" somebody. You've got to read to your kids.

It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging.\r\n\r\nAl-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague, the court says.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high.\r\n\r\nThe violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations.\r\n\r\nThe militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength.\r\n\r\nIn his appeal to the court Monday, Moreno-Ocampo complained that the judges' standard for adding the genocide charge to the warrant is too high.\r\n\r\nThe judges want him to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that al-Bashir committed genocide, but that level of proof is not required for a warrant, which only requires a reasonable inference of guilt, he said.\r\n\r\n\"They are requesting a level of evidence that is the level of evidence required at the trial stage, not at the beginning of the process,\" Moreno-Ocampo said.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason that prosecutors cannot provide more evidence at this stage is because al-Bashir is attacking witnesses who are willing to provide information to prosecutors, Moreno-Ocampo said. Presenting more evidence could endanger the victims, he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's a legal issue,\" he said. \"The judgment by itself is very important, but in addition I cannot accept this wrong legal standard.\"\r\n\r\nThe judges believe the crimes that Moreno-Ocampo classifies as genocide instead fall under the category of crimes against humanity, he said.\r\n\r\nEven if Moreno-Ocampo were successful in adding genocide to the warrant, he would still face a difficult task in proving the charges at trial, said Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar Association.\r\n\r\n\"Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet (than war crimes and crimes against humanity) because you have to show in proving genocide that there was an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race,\" Ellis told CNN. \"Obviously the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Moreno-Ocampo loses the appeal, Ellis said, it would not minimize the seriousness of the case.\r\n\r\n\"The charges that have been (alleged", "4405": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Western politicians are currently scrambling for air tickets to Kiev.

The story about a prostitute in Tokyo sold nearly 3 million copies and was adapted for film, television and Manga, or Japanese comics.\r\n\r\nPublishing phenomenon\r\n\r\nA struggling Japanese publishing industry was quick to take notice of the growing popularity of keitai shosetsu, especially early works like Yoshi's \"Deep Love.\" Many of the popular cell phone novels have since been turned into paperbacks, and bookstores across Japan now have entire sections devoted to the digital-age literary genre.\r\n\r\nBy 2007, half of the country's 10 best-selling novels were written on cell phones, according to book distributor Tohan while last year mobile novels and comics were a $240 million market in Japan, which is over 5 percent of the country's $4.5 billion total mobile content market, according to Japan's Mobile Content Forum.\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, three Japanese mobile phone novel publishers reported collective sales of 1.7 million copies. Publishers, like Goma Books, one of the first to print cell phone novels, have also launched their own keitai shosetsu sites, which they use to sift through for talent whose work will be marketable on bookshelves.\r\n\r\nGoma's mobile story site Orion carries 20,000 novels and has approximately two million monthly users, according to the company. Goma has also published several top-selling keitai shosetsu, including \"The Red Thread,\" by Mei (also a pen name).\r\n\r\nSince it was released in 2007, the story, which revolves around the romance of two middle school students, has sold nearly 2 million copies and was adapted for a TV series and movie last December. The publishing house now prints a new mobile novel every month.\r\n\r\nSome literary purist don't think the cell phone novels constitute real literature, but their popularity is undeniable.\r\n\r\n\"The sentences may be a bit immature. It doesn't have a major plot line sometimes.

Everyone from Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black and radio personality Rachel Maddow to Joe Solmonese, the president of Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay advocacy group, seem to be blasting Obama for everything from \"don't ask don't tell\" to Adam Lambert not winning American Idol.\r\n\r\nIn their minds, Obama is not moving fast enough on behalf of the GLBT community. The outcry is not completely without merit -- the Justice Department's unnerving brief on the Defense of Marriage Act immediately comes to mind. I was upset by some of the statements, but not surprised. (After the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, President Ronald Reagan's initial handling of AIDS and, more recently, Katrina, there is little that surprises me when it comes to the government and the treatment of its people.)\r\n\r\nStill, rarely has criticism regarding Obama and the GLBT community come from the kind of person you would find standing in line at a spot like The Prop House, and there's a reason for that.\r\n\r\nDespite the catchiness of the slogan, gay is not the new black.\r\n\r\nBlack is still black.\r\n\r\nAnd if any group should know this, it's the gay community.\r\n\r\nBars such as The Prop House, or Bulldogs in Atlanta, Georgia, exist because a large number of gay blacks -- particularly those who date other blacks, and live in the black community -- do not feel a part of the larger gay movement. There are Gay Pride celebrations, and then there are Black Gay Prides.\r\n\r\nThere's a popular bar in the heart of the nation's capital that might as well rename itself Antebellum, because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor. Last year at the annual Human Rights Campaign national fundraiser in Washington, D.C. -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment.\r\n\r\nWhen Proposition 8 passed in California, white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent. At protest rallies that followed, some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants. Not to split hairs, but for most blacks, the n-word trumps the f-word.\r\n\r\nSo while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television, blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry. They see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets. And then there is the history.\r\n\r\nThe 40th anniversary of Stonewall dominated Gay Pride celebrations around the country, and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized, 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood-soaked years black people have been through in this country. There are stories some blacks lived through, stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told.\r\n\r\nWhile those who were at Stonewall talk about the fear of being arrested by police, 40 years ago, blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated. The 13th Amendment was signed in 1865, and it wasn't until 1948 that President Harry S Truman desegregated the military. That's more than an 80-year gap.\r\n\r\nNot to be flip, but Miley Cyrus is older than Bill Clinton's \"don't ask, don't tell.\" That doesn't mean that the safety of gay people should be trivialized or that Obama should not be held accountable for the promises he made on the campaign trail. But to call this month's first-ever White House reception for GLBT leaders \"too little too late\" is akin to a petulant child throwing a tantrum because he wants to eat his dessert before dinner. This is one of the main reasons why so many blacks bristle at the comparison of the two movements -- everybody wants to sing the blues, nobody wants to live them.\r\n\r\nThis lack of perspective is only going to alienate a black", "4499": "more than three weeks", "4500": "seven", "4501": "Clarkson", "4502": "the items", "4503": "seven", "4504": "homophobia", "4505": "Abdul Rahman al-Rashed", "4506": "apartheid", "4507": "Robert Mugabe", "4508": "Natasha Richardson", "4509": "Anna", "4510": "first player to complete three triple-centuries", "4511": "A family spokesman on Saturday", "4512": "Greenland's ice core", "4513": "Maersk Alabama", "4514": "ballot tally sheets from Managua", "4515": "Lewis", "4516": "Sir Benjamin Hall", "4517": "every step of the way", "4518": "the death of Osama bin Laden", "4519": "Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice", "4520": "focus shift to more bang for the buck during the economic downturn", "4521": "Durban", "4522": "brag about possessions and purchases", "4523": "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The only checks Chris Chelios should be concerned about are the ones he's writing for his children's college tuition", "4524": "Hugh Jackman", "4525": "John McHugh", "4526": "global Roots and Shoots", "4527": "some concern\" about the safety of BPA, and supports efforts by industry to remove BPA from infant bottles and feeding cups", "4528": "Patrick Vieira", "4529": "Mehdi Army and U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces, which are dominated by a rival Shiite group", "4530": "Serena Williams", "4531": "costing", "4532": "Ayatollah Ali Khamenei", "4533": "House of Raeford Farms", "4534": "321", "4535": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Catherine Zeta-Jones is limbering up for her Broadway debut.\r\n\r\nCatherine Zeta-Jones will make her Broadway debut in Stephen Sondheim's \"A Little Night Music.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oscar-winning star of \"Chicago\" will appear alongside Angela Lansbury in a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical \"A Little Night Music,\" according to an announcement from the show's producers.\r\n\r\nThe production is set to open December 13 at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York's theater district.

Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko", "4808": "Shiite areas", "4809": "your services, your family", "4810": "sympathize", "4811": "14", "4812": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Relatives and friends of a judge and court reporter killed in a 2005 shooting at Atlanta's Fulton County Courthouse", "4813": "100 yards", "4814": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Catherine Zeta-Jones is limbering up for her Broadway debut.\r\n\r\nCatherine Zeta-Jones will make her Broadway debut in Stephen Sondheim's \"A Little Night Music.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oscar-winning star of \"Chicago\" will appear alongside Angela Lansbury in a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical \"A Little Night Music,\" according to an announcement from the show's producers.\r\n\r\nThe production is set to open December 13 at the Walter Kerr Theater", "4815": "the physical world, digitizing", "4816": "Nebraska", "4817": "The 500-year-old painting", "4818": "sick with worry", "4819": "16", "4820": "Jackson 5 -- arrayed behind them.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson brothers, here in the 1970s, were driven to be great by their father, Joseph.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be the all-American clan, gold records arranged behind them, the boys loose and smiling, the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor.\r\n\r\nOver the years, that fa\u00e7ade crumbled. The brothers bickered; some made accusations of abuse. But the group remained tight-knit through crises, including Thursday's tragedy, when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center.\r\n\r\nThe journey began with music in Gary, Indiana. Joseph Jackson, the patriarch, played in a short-lived band called the Falcons (no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett) in the 1950s. His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel.\r\n\r\nKatherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966.\r\n\r\nBy that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: \"He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, \"Please don't be mad at me.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson disputed the word \"beat,\" but didn't question Michael's account.\r\n\r\n\"I whipped him with a switch and a belt,\" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, \"I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick.\"\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions.\r\n\r\n\"We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,\" he said. \"I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \"chitlin circuit\" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \"the last big stars to come off my assembly line,\" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site.\r\n\r\nThe group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a collaboration,\" Gamble said. \"They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians.\"\r\n\r\nHuff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a \"fantastic meal\" cooked by Katherine Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing but respect for the father,\" added Gamble. \"He's a great man. He made something out of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nEven during that era, however, Michael was standing out. Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded. Going solo with Quincy Jones producing, as he did in 1979, was the right move, Gamble and Huff said.\r\n\r\nThe family dynamics kept changing", "4821": "felony conspiracy counts", "4822": "in a hail of bullets as they stood outside a store selling ethnic goods", "4823": "FMLN", "4824": "February 13, 2009", "4825": "International law", "4826": "Susan Boyle continued to make newspaper headlines in the UK Sunday following her shock defeat in the final of \"Britain's Got Talent.\"\r\n\r\nSusan Boyle fans watch her perform for the final time on \"Britain's Got Talent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boyle Backlash\" said the headline in the tabloid News of the World, suggesting that the Scottish", "4827": "abuse toward Christians in Iraq", "4828": "the officer hospitalized", "4829": "Thirty-three percent", "4830": "Manchester United and England", "4831": "silver", "4832": "Turkish Arab family", "4833": "Michael Jackson", "4834": "zoos, aquariums and schools showing them how they can help conserve water.

But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \"With its this-is-really-happening vibe, 'Paranormal Activity' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich\u00e9s. The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the film has earned a strong 85 percent approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\r\n\r\nMoviegoers agree.

force such products off the market if manufacturers don't do it voluntarily. According to Sharfstein, the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nBisphenol-A is found in many products, but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula, and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys. A handful of states and cities including Minnesota, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, have passed laws in some form banning BPA in products meant for children.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position is a partial reversal of the FDA's declaration in 2008 that BPA has no adverse effects. That announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry-funded research.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince then, the agency says on its Web site, \"recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals. While BPA is not proven to harm children or adults, these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of BPA.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program, which in its own 2008 report said there is \"some concern\" for BPA's effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. Other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the authors of those studies say it's not clear the problems were actually caused by BPA.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt a news conference Friday, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said further research is needed \"to determine if and when further action is needed.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has been allotted $30 million to study the health effects of BPA. Hamburg said that research would likely be complete in 18 to 24 months.

Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons.\r\n\r\nHis attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is \"not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything.\"\r\n\r\nA woman identifying herself as Markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News.

What else is new??\"\r\n\r\nSuffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters, \"This was a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them.\"\r\n\r\nA procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, Conley said.\r\n\r\nA Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman \"put up a fight,\" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service.\r\n\r\nShe sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified.\r\n\r\nAuthorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.  Watch police say assailant has perused Craigslist ads \u00bb\r\n\r\nSurveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man.\r\n\r\nPolice traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and \"the case just begins to build from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,\" Conley said.\r\n\r\nThere may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. \"If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is \"bearing up,\" according to attorney Salsberg.\r\n\r\n\"It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty,\" said Salsberg.\r\n\r\nMcAllister, in her e-mail to ABC, wrote, \"Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it.
