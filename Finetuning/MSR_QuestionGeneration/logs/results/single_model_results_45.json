Sunday's election could be seen as a referendum on the euro-elites who so strongly opposed that war.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe conservatives who governed Spain in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the United States after the 9/11 attacks. In 2003-2004, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as George Bush's most prominent ally on the European continent. Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel.\r\r\n\r\r\nYet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels -- and staggering government deficits. The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts.\r\r\n\r\r\nZapatero slunk out of town a little while ago.

The object was expected to pass \"on the fringes\" of the 2 km-by-25 km-by-25 km (1.25 mile-by-15 mile-by-15 mile) safety zone controllers monitor, Dye said.\r\n\r\n\"It's a very low probability of hit -- less than one in 100,000,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe space shuttle Discovery is currently headed toward the station for a scheduled docking Tuesday, but the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris, said LeRoy Cain, the shuttle program's deputy manager.\r\n\r\nLast week, a piece of debris forced the space station's current crew -- astronauts Mike Fincke and Sandy Magnus, and cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov -- to take shelter in its escape capsule, a rare close call for the orbiting platform, NASA said.\r\n\r\nThat object, a chunk of metal from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission, was about 5 inches across, and moving at nearly 20,000 mph. It passed within 3 miles of the station early Thursday afternoon and was detected too late for the station to maneuver out of the way, controllers said. iReport.com: See, share your photos of launches and space\r\n\r\nCain called the prospect of two close passes in less than a week a \"random\" occurrence, but said controllers have frequently had to maneuver around pieces of orbital junk.\r\n\r\n\"It's part of the business,\" he said. \"It comes with the territory, and we'll continue", "151": "the National Archives", "152": "Steve Earle", "153": "Los Angeles Staples Center arena", "154": "updating medical records", "155": "the day it was going to end", "156": "Monday", "157": "15-year-old", "158": "Barcelona", "159": "MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The children in their party outfits on the red carpet", "160": "Hosni Mubarak addressed his country, telling the Egyptian that he must make good on his promises and avoid a violent response to the thousands of protesters in the streets.\r\r\n\r\r\nWith parts of his capital ablaze, Mubarak said he was asking his government to resign and would soon announce a new one, pledging to address the concerns of thousand of Egyptians protesting in Cairo's streets.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I just spoke to him after his speech,\" Obama said, \"and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words, to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise. Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise,\" Obama said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. president repeated his administration's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged \"concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama's remarks, delivered from State Dining Room, were the strongest yet from the United States. \"There must be reform,\" he said, \"political, social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In the absence of these reforms,\" he said, \"grievances have built up over time.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free and more hopeful,\" he concluded.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn his remarks, Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding. And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as \"hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, \"and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption.\" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported. A CNN witness saw the building ablaze.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said the collective consequences of the government's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Within that review is military\" assistance, Gibbs said.\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The die is cast,\" said Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said, \"we've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms\" but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We don't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together,\" Gelb said, cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government.\r\r\n\r\r\nOften considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East, Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal, a strategic passageway for trade across the region.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt's government \"to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters, and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces,\" Clinton said Friday, referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"At the same time, protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"As a partner, we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately,\" Clinton said. \"They need to view civil society as their partner, not a threat.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nServers of Egypt's main internet provider were down early Friday, including servers for the Egyptian government's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarly Friday, Gibbs said that he is \"very concerned about violence in Egypt,\" tweeting that the \"government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut at least one internet service provider, Noor, was still working.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to \"defer non-essential travel to Egypt.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes,\" the agency added in a written travel alert.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times,\" the statement said, urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone.\r\r\n\r\r\nDelta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday, and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Barack Obama has requested \"multiple briefings\" on Egypt, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the target of the protesters' anger, \"but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels, including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama's messages and concerns are relayed,\" Vietor said.\r\r\n\r\r\nFormer Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak \"without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think that, if anything, one might ask why hasn't President Mubarak called President Obama and said, 'Are you with me or against me?' I mean, that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration,\" Cohen said.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances,\" he said this week.\r\r\n\r\r\nVice President Joe Biden said on \"PBS NewsHour\" on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator.\r\r\n\r\r\nStill, Biden said, \"violence isn't appropriate, and people have a right to protest.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe noted Thursday that Mubarak has been \"very helpful on a range of tough issues,\" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Wednesday, Gibbs said the U.S. administration was \"monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so, obviously, in Tunisia.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali", "161": "saying the secondhand smoke inside a vehicle can cause severe health problems for children and adults", "162": "the error \"an aberration", "163": "Rohingya", "164": "10", "165": "her acting chops and sing", "166": "307", "167": "first lady Laura Bush", "168": "about 20", "169": "Michael Friel", "170": "three years ago", "171": "labor unions", "172": "$5 million assistance package,\" Fore added.\r\n\r\nThe United State will immediately obligate approximately $1.5 million", "173": "exchange for his guilty plea", "174": "Thursday.\r\r\n\r\r\nPinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu identified the dead as a father and his three children, plus two other men.

It was the first time the public heard comments from Sullenberger and first officer Jeffrey B. Skiles describing Thursday's emergency landing.\n\nSkiles was flying US Airways Flight 1549, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, when he noticed a flock of birds less than 90 seconds after the plane had taken off from New York's LaGuardia International Airport, Higgins said.\n\nIn an instant, the plane was rocked by loud thuds and both engines went out, Higgins said.  Watch the plane hit the water \u00bb\n\n\"He commented on the formation, and he said the next thing he knew, the windscreen was filled with birds. There was no time to take evasive action,\" Higgins said.\n\nSullenberger took control of the aircraft while Skiles began complicated procedures to try to restart the engines, Higgins said.\n\nSullenberger thought the plane was moving \"too low, too slow\" to risk returning to LaGuardia through the maze of buildings. Nor did Sullenberger think the powerless aircraft could make it over the densely populated New Jersey area to Teterboro, Higgins said.\n\n\"There could be catastrophic consequences if we didn't make it,\" she quoted Sullenberger as saying.  Watch CNN's Lisa Sylvester report on the pilots \u00bb\n\nCity officials, passengers and aviation experts have lauded Sullenberger and the flight crew for their handling of the landing and also praised first responders who acted quickly to minimize passengers' injuries in below-freezing temperatures. All 155 people on board the plane survived.\n\n\"These are both very experienced pilots. They knew what they had to do,\" Higgins said.\n\nNeither Sullenberger nor Skiles attended the news conference.\n\nEarlier in the day, the NTSB revealed the content of communications between the cockpit and controllers at LaGuardia in the brief period during which the incident unfolded.\n\n\"This is cactus 1549, hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines,\" Sullenberger told controllers at approximately 3:27 p.m. Thursday. \"We're turning back towards LaGuardia.\"\n\nControllers immediately began preparations to clear a runway for an emergency landing, but less than a minute later, Sullenberger reported that the aircraft wouldn't make it, Higgins said.\n\nThe last communication from the plane to controllers, Higgins said, was the pilot saying, \"We're gonna be in the Hudson.\"  Watch a former pilot tell how to water-land a plane \u00bb\n\nHiggins also quoted two of the flight's attendants, who were in jump seats at the front of the aircraft when they heard a loud thud shortly after takeoff.\n\n\"It was a sound that neither one of them had ever heard before,\" Higgins said. \"They said all the engine noise ceased. They described it as complete silence, like a library.\"\n\nEfforts to raise the jetliner from the river proved successful late Saturday, as cranes lifted it clear of the water about 11:30 p.m. ET following several hours of work by crews in frigid conditions.\n\nVideo from the scene showed the right side of the aircraft with the engine intact but its covering mangled. It was not clear visually whether the damage was from an in-flight incident or from the landing impact.\n\nInvestigators planned to tow the plane on a barge to an undisclosed location for their examination.  Watch water wash over the plane \u00bb\n\nSearchers using sonar think they have found the left engine on the river bottom. Divers will try to confirm the finding, Higgins said.  Watch workers begin the retrieval process \u00bb\n\nThe flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- both crucial to determining exactly what happened Thursday -- remained on the aircraft, which was still largely submerged in the Hudson River but was secured to moorings.\n\nStrong currents and cold water thwarted divers' efforts to retrieve the recorders from the tail section of the jetliner, Higgins said.\n\nAlso Saturday, authorities released audio and transcripts of two 911 calls from people who said they saw that the plane was in trouble.  Listen to callers report plane in the river \u00bb\n\nOne caller said he saw the plane descend and reported hearing a loud noise shortly after the aircraft took off.\n\n\"Oh, my God! It was a big plane, I heard a big boom just now. We looked up, and the plane came straight over us, and it was turning. Oh, my God!\" a man calling from the Bronx told a 911 operator at 3:29 p.m., three minutes after the plane left LaGuardia.\n\nMinutes later, at 3:33 p.m., a woman called 911 and reported seeing the plane in the water.\n\n\"A plane has just crashed into the Hudson River,\" she told an operator. \"A US Air big DC-9", "176": "amputated", "177": "Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev.\n\nVidic clashes with Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci during the UEFA Champions League Group F match.\n\nThe former Spartak Moscow player sat out Saturday's 4-1 victory at Aston Villa after suffering concussion during the Premier League win over Wigan immediately before the international break.\n\nHowever, he has made a good recovery and will now partner Rio Ferdinand in the heart of the United defense.\n\nInjury-plagued French striker Louis Saha definitely misses the tie with a long-term knee problem and fellow casualties Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves also stayed behind.\n\nEngland striker Wayne Rooney, who scored twice against Villa and was also on target in England's Euro 2008 defeat against Russia in Moscow last week, will partner Carlos Tevez in attack.\n\nA third successive victory after 1-0 wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma", "178": "Ben Gurion Airport", "179": "Ahmed", "180": "LOS ANGELES", "181": "JAMAICA", "182": "her father's home", "183": "February 13, 2009", "184": "pirates", "185": "war crimes", "186": "the 30-year rule", "187": "Greenpeace study", "188": "Mirza", "189": "genocide", "190": "eight or nine", "191": "Poets", "192": "Democratic senators", "193": "80", "194": "posthumous column", "195": "biochar,\" a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste", "196": "LIMA, Peru (CNN) -- Tensions between Chile and Peru remained high Monday after last week's revelation that Peru's top army general said at a party that Chileans in Peru would be sent back in coffins or body bags.\r\n\r\nGeneral Edwin Donayre, right, meets with Peruvian President Alan Garcia in Lima, Peru, last year.\r\n\r\nChilean President Michelle Bachelet met Monday morning with her domestic advisers to discuss the matter after the Peruvian general appeared unrepentant over the weekend, the Chilean government reported on its Web site.\r\n\r\nPeruvian President Alan Garc\u00eda had called Bachelet last week to say that the statements by Gen.

The bargains are mostly fake ones during those 10 days because patterns are completely disrupted by gift cards. Most people are off from work between Christmas and New Years, have the time to shop and have the gift cards burning a hole in their wallets.\r\n\r\nStores are able to \"pretend\" to offer bargains in the immediate after-Christmas period and people feel like they \"have\" to spend right away with store credit from returns and that gift card dough.

Year after year, she forced me to take them at our local pool in Iowa City. Having to go against my will seemed all the more unfair to me, since my mother could not swim and was actually afraid of the water.\r\n\r\nBut my mother reasoned that if water came between her children and their safety, she would be helpless.\r\n\r\n\"I can't save you,\" she would calmly state in answer to my pleas to bow out of the lessons. \"So I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you can save yourself.\" Real Simple: Mother-daughter relationships\r\n\r\nIt's no wonder she embraced this philosophy of self-reliance. She knew how unexpectedly life can rob you of someone you care about. My parents adopted me as an infant and went on to have a biological child -- my brother, Jason -- a couple of years later.\r\n\r\nMy dad was an electrician, and he died in an accident on the job when I was three. After his death, my mother had to raise us alone, and she was acutely aware that she was truly on her own, with no backup plan. She was fiercely strong and yet constantly fearful.\r\n\r\nI have almost no memories of my father. Instead I remember Mike Fieseler. He was a former industrial-arts teacher whom my mother dated off and on for much of my childhood. Jason and I weren't his biggest fans. He was a man of strict rules, while my mom's approach could be more properly deemed overindulgent leniency. iReport.com: Share your bonding with dad memories\r\n\r\nWe resented having to share the spotlight with him -- a sentiment that was particularly strong every Christmas morning, when we had to wait for him to arrive before we could open gifts. (There is little a man can do to endear himself to children less than delaying Christmas-morning gratification.) And when they stopped dating, when I was 15, I wasn't unhappy to see him go. Real Simple: Small, helpful gestures with big impact\r\n\r\nThen, on February 18, 1991, when I was 17, my mother suddenly died of a brain aneurysm. One minute she was laughing with friends, enjoying an evening out; the next, she was unconscious on the floor. She never woke up. Just 19 hours later, she was dead, leaving my 15-year-old brother and me orphans.\r\n\r\nIn the moments of shock and horror that followed, my relatives all gathered in the hospital, and I went home with only a close friend for company (Jason followed a while later). We spent that night on our own. I was numb; it had all happened so fast. I could barely think beyond the immediate moment.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, my grandfather, aunts, and uncles were still immersed in their own mourning. Shell-shocked as I was, I knew I had to let people know what had happened. I saw my mother's address book lying where she had set it only days before and started dialing. One of the phone numbers I found was Mike's.\r\n\r\nEven though he lived about an hour away, it felt like he was there in an instant. As soon as he walked in, he took charge -- and took care of Jason and me. Among other small kindnesses, he gave me a credit card and said, \"Why don't you buy something to wear to the funeral?\" He gave me permission to be a 17-year-old -- to focus on the more mundane issue of what I was going to wear instead of weighty adult concerns. Real Simple: Father's Day gift ideas\r\n\r\nGenerally, when children are orphaned, a family member comes forward to take them in. This didn't happen in our case. Everyone had a good reason, I suppose. My mom's father was too old to assume responsibility for us; my mother's sister and her husband had three kids of their own and weren't able to take in any others; her other two siblings were both single and worked long hours. The guardian named in my mother's will was a babysitter that none of us had seen in 15 years.\r\n\r\nBut I can tell you this: Abandonment, even for very good reasons, feels awful. It was heartbreaking and terrifying to have lost the person we loved most and then to be set adrift.\r\n\r\nMonths passed and it felt like our relatives could offer no reassurances. The only news we got was that if Jason and I remained without a guardian, we would have to enter foster care. Our mother was gone, and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd, once again, there was Mike. After the funeral, he was a constant presence. He made sure that food filled the cupboards, the bills were paid, and the lawn was mowed. (Mike's adult daughter, Linda, pitched in and took care of his house.) He made sure I went back to school even when it was the last thing I wanted to do. His overbearing personality -- the trait I had hated the most -- is what comforted me the most and got me through those difficult days.\r\n\r\nMike says that Linda came up with the idea to make his role with Jason and me official -- he could become our guardian. He was on board right away. Mike still says he never considered not doing it; caring for us was simply the right thing to do. One day he made us his offer. In a moment where the grief of loss and the pain of being unwanted threatened to capture my very breath, this man, whose only tie to us was having dated my mother, said he would be honored to take us in.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, everything was different. His girlfriend, Patty, threw us a \"guardian party\" when the paperwork became official. It was just a small gathering, but it made us feel special. I received a key chain with my initials, and I remember thinking that the idea behind it was so lovely.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Mike has become not merely a legal guardian but a real father to me. When I fell into depression in college, unable to get past thoughts of my mother and all I had lost, he was there to listen.\r\n\r\nWhen my husband, Eric, and I bought our first house, Mike spent weekends installing insulation and repairing our gutters. He never wrote me off as a good, mature kid who could handle everything herself. He walked the line between trusting me and recognizing when I might need help. And what more could you want from a father than that?\r\n\r\nHis was an unconventional path to parenthood, to say the least. It is not by birth or adoption that I consider this man to be my father; it isn't even through his presence in my childhood. It is rather by sheer good luck on my part.\r\n\r\nBefore he made that generous offer, I felt as though I had lost my mooring and the waters were flooding in; afterward, I simply felt rescued. If my mother had taught me to be strong and depend on myself, Mike imparted his own lesson -- that the world will provide for you, even when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nEight years after Mike", "283": "The German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services.

[We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community.\r\n\r\nCNN: And you did it by writing?\r\n\r\nAlexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years.\r\n\r\nCNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you?\r\n\r\nAlexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, \"Isn't that something?\" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's ahead of us?\r\n\r\nAlexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ...\r\n\r\nThe larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions.

You can't just have, let's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday or a day of service. We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year.\r\n\r\nWe need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ... But without that kind of family support, then we need Boys and Girls Clubs. We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We need mentors. Otherwise, these kids will find bad adults to copy from, and we're going to lose them.\r\n\r\nLemon: I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me.\r\n\r\nLemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort?\r\n\r\nPowell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched.

The brothers bickered; some made accusations of abuse. But the group remained tight-knit through crises, including Thursday's tragedy, when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center.\r\n\r\nThe journey began with music in Gary, Indiana. Joseph Jackson, the patriarch, played in a short-lived band called the Falcons (no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett) in the 1950s. His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel.\r\n\r\nKatherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966.\r\n\r\nBy that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: \"He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, \"Please don't be mad at me.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson disputed the word \"beat,\" but didn't question Michael's account.\r\n\r\n\"I whipped him with a switch and a belt,\" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, \"I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick.\"\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions.\r\n\r\n\"We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,\" he said. \"I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \"chitlin circuit\" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \"the last big stars to come off my assembly line,\" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site.\r\n\r\nThe group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a collaboration,\" Gamble said. \"They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians.\"\r\n\r\nHuff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a \"fantastic meal\" cooked by Katherine Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing but respect for the father,\" added Gamble. \"He's a great man.

Thursday's report said the Davis case exposed the deep concerns over the death penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972, when the (Supreme) Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases,\" the report said.\r\r\n\r\r\nA CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in October found that for the first time in recent memory, more Americans favor a sentence of life in prison over the death penalty for murderers -- 50% to 48%.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat's not to say that Americans want to abolish the death penalty entirely.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther polls have shown majorities generally favor it, but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said his analysis shows there is a difference between thinking the government should have the death penalty as an option and actually wanting to see it applied.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe decline in the number who prefer the death penalty as the punishment for murder may be related to the growing number who believe that at least one person in the past five years has been executed for a crime that he or she did not commit.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 2005, when a solid majority preferred the death penalty, 59% believed that an innocent person had been executed within the previous five years. Now that figure has risen dramatically, to 72%.\r\r\n\r\r\nDavis drew widespread support for his claims that an innocent man was being put to death, after federal and state courts had rejected his calls for a new trial.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince Davis' conviction in 1991, seven of the nine witnesses against him recanted their testimony, and no physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of a Savannah police officer. However, a federal judge concluded the death row inmate \"vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nA Texas execution in July also attracted international attention. Mexican national Humberto Leal Garcia was convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl. A world court found the state violated his rights by not giving Leal access to his home country's consulate upon his arrest in 1994, as required by an international treaty. U.S. and Mexican officials, along with a variety of human rights groups, urged Texas to delay the execution, but to no avail.\r\r\n\r\r\nTexas continues to lead the nation as the busiest death penalty state, with 13 executions this year. Alabama was next with six, and Ohio with five. No more are scheduled until next month.\r\r\n\r\r\nThirty-four states have capital laws, but only 13 states carried out that ultimate punishment in 2011. In addition, several states with capital punishment laws did not sentence anyone to death in 2011, including Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and South Carolina.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnother high-profile murder convict in Pennsylvania saw his death sentence commuted. Prosecutors decided this month not to give Mumia Abu-Jamal a new capital sentencing hearing. He was convicted of murdering Philadelphia police office Daniel Faulkner, but has long claimed his innocence as a victim of what he called a racist criminal justice system. He will spend the rest of his life in prison.\r\r\n\r\r\nCalifornia voters could decide next year whether to abandon the death penalty. That state has the highest death row population -- 721 people -- but no one has been executed there since 2006, when a court-ordered moratorium was declared.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut one state that rarely has applied the death penalty could see two notorious killers receive that punishment. Steven Hayes was sentenced to death in Connecticut in December 2010, and a jury this month recommended the same punishment for Joshua Komisarjevsky. They were found guilty of home-invasion killings that left a mother and her two daughters dead.

Panama has been a center of money-laundering for dug cartels and other organized crime groups for many years. And Guatemala has seen its share of slayings and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\"It's a recognition that there is a shared problem and that they can't solve that problem independent of each other,\" said Robert Pastor, a professor of international relations at American University in Washington who served as a national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nJennifer McCoy, the director of The Americas Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta, says it is \"encouraging\" that presidents Felipe Calderon of Mexico, Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, Alvaro Colom of Guatemala and Martin Torrijos of Panama not only recognize the problem but want to meet to see what they can do about it.\r\n\r\n\"The issue of security is vital in these countries and in Latin America,\" McCoy said.\r\n\r\nIt's not just a threat for Latin America, a recent report from the U.S. military says. The violence in Mexico and elsewhere south of the border could spill over to the United States, says the report, issued in November by the U.S. Joint Forces Command.\r\n\r\n\"The growing assault by the drug cartels and their thugs on the Mexican government over the past several years reminds one that an unstable Mexico could represent a homeland security problem of immense proportions to the United States,\" says the report, \"Joint Operating Environment 2008.\"\r\n\r\nThat instability could threaten the United States' underbelly along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico.\r\n\r\n\"Any descent by Mexico into chaos would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone,\" the report says.\r\n\r\nMexican Secretary of Governance Fernando Gomez Mont rejected that notion in an interview with CNN this week, saying it is \"inadmissible\" that the United States would have to intervene.\r\n\r\nPastor, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1994 to become U.S. ambassador to Panama, believes the United States should be more involved now.\r\n\r\n\"The United States is a major part of the problem,\" he said. \"The dollars are coming from the United States. The demand is coming from the United States. The arms are coming from the United States.\"\r\n\r\nPastor pointed out that there are 7,600 gun shops in the United States within 100 miles of the Mexican border.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have a clear recognition that that we are part of their problem, and they can't solve it without us,\" he said.\r\n\r\nPanamanian Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro indicated at a news conference this week that other nations also need to be more involved.\r\n\r\nHe didn't mention the United States but it was clear whom he was talking about. The summit leaders will ask nations that have high drug consumption to do their part to reduce that demand, the Spanish news agency EFE quoted Lewis as saying.\r\n\r\nMexican President Calderon met with President-elect Barack Obama in Washington this week and security was a prime subject of their discussions.\r\n\r\n\"Both countries share a long border,\" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. \"They are terribly worried about the violence from organized crime in Mexico and slipover into the U.S.\"\r\n\r\nHakim met with Calderon at a private dinner hosted by the Mexican president Sunday night.\r\n\r\nAfter his meeting with Obama on Monday", "947": "homes flooded", "948": "2004.\r\r\n\r\r\nAristide told reporters gathered at a hotel near Johannesburg's international airport that he is ready to return from exile as soon as today.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"To symbolize our readiness we have decided to meet not just anywhere but here in the shadow of the Oliver Tambo International airport,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"As far as we are concerned we are ready to leave today", "949": "Joshua Clottey", "950": "20", "951": "6.1", "952": "George Hamilton's mother Anne", "953": "distress call from an Indian-flagged commercial ship", "954": "Amnesty International report into maternal mortality in the South American country.\r\r\n\r\r\nVertical births where women are kneeling or crouching and holding on to a rope are common in Peru.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report, \"Fatal Flaws", "955": "self-imposed", "956": "The game's combat has been fine-tuned", "957": "The GOP", "958": "Some 40,000 people were now living in government-run relief camps", "959": "Saturday", "960": "December", "961": "the National Institutes of Health Web site", "962": "Twitter", "963": "graves", "964": "young New Zealander Sofia Walker", "965": "Sunday had already been postponed by the SPL", "966": "high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.\r\n\r\n\"This machine right here is our baby,\" said UGA research engineer Brian Bibens, who is one of a handful of researchers around the world working on alternative ways to recycle carbon.\r\n\r\nBibens' specialty is \"biochar,\" a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste. The raw material can be any forest, agricultural or animal waste. Some examples are woodchips, corn husks, peanut shells, even chicken manure.\r\n\r\nBibens feeds the waste -- called \"biomass\" -- into an octagonally shaped metal barrel where it is cooked under intense heat, sometimes above 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the organic matter is cooked through a thermochemical process called \"pyrolysis\".\r\n\r\nIn a few hours, organic trash is transformed into charcoal-like pellets farmers can turn into fertilizer.  Gasses given off during the process can be harnesed to fuel vehicles of power electric generators.

But instead, Logan says he took the money and did only a portion of the work -- leaving the entire second floor bare to the beams and plastic wrap still covering much of the exterior.\r\n\r\nLogan's financial squeeze tightened when one of the actress' talent agencies shut down without paying her for commercial work.\r\n\r\nThe 55-year-old divorced mother of three fell far behind on her mortgage and other debt payments, leading her to seek help from Consumer Credit Counseling of New Jersey. Counselor Pamela Glass brainstormed with Logan to envision potential extra sources of income.\r\n\r\n\"We put our heads together to make extra money,\" Glass said. \"I said, 'Take a look at what you can do.' She said, 'I bake once in a while'. I said, 'Well, maybe you can do some baking.' \"\r\n\r\nWhen Logan asked, neighbors, fellow church congregants and classmates responded. Soon she was baking night and day, two cakes at a time. Al Hamdi, general manager of the Hilton in nearby Hasbrouck Heights, heard of Logan's plan and offered the hotel's four giant ovens, letting her accelerate production.\r\n\r\n\"She was going to do something out of the box to save her home and her family.

Everyone from Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black and radio personality Rachel Maddow to Joe Solmonese, the president of Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay advocacy group, seem to be blasting Obama for everything from \"don't ask don't tell\" to Adam Lambert not winning American Idol.\r\n\r\nIn their minds, Obama is not moving fast enough on behalf of the GLBT community. The outcry is not completely without merit -- the Justice Department's unnerving brief on the Defense of Marriage Act immediately comes to mind. I was upset by some of the statements, but not surprised. (After the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, President Ronald Reagan's initial handling of AIDS and, more recently, Katrina, there is little that surprises me when it comes to the government and the treatment of its people.)\r\n\r\nStill, rarely has criticism regarding Obama and the GLBT community come from the kind of person you would find standing in line at a spot like The Prop House, and there's a reason for that.\r\n\r\nDespite the catchiness of the slogan, gay is not the new black.\r\n\r\nBlack is still black.\r\n\r\nAnd if any group should know this, it's the gay community.\r\n\r\nBars such as The Prop House, or Bulldogs in Atlanta, Georgia, exist because a large number of gay blacks -- particularly those who date other blacks, and live in the black community -- do not feel a part of the larger gay movement. There are Gay Pride celebrations, and then there are Black Gay Prides.\r\n\r\nThere's a popular bar in the heart of the nation's capital that might as well rename itself Antebellum, because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor. Last year at the annual Human Rights Campaign national fundraiser in Washington, D.C. -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment.\r\n\r\nWhen Proposition 8 passed in California, white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent. At protest rallies that followed, some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants. Not to split hairs, but for most blacks, the n-word trumps the f-word.\r\n\r\nSo while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television, blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry. They see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets. And then there is the history.\r\n\r\nThe 40th anniversary of Stonewall dominated Gay Pride celebrations around the country, and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized, 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood-soaked years black people have been through in this country. There are stories some blacks lived through, stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told.\r\n\r\nWhile those who were at Stonewall talk about the fear of being arrested by police, 40 years ago, blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated. The 13th Amendment was signed in 1865, and it wasn't until 1948 that President Harry S Truman desegregated the military. That's more than an 80-year gap.\r\n\r\nNot to be flip, but Miley Cyrus is older than Bill Clinton's \"don't ask, don't tell.\" That doesn't mean that the safety of gay people should be trivialized or that Obama should not be held accountable for the promises he made on the campaign trail. But to call this month's first-ever White House reception for GLBT leaders \"too little too late\" is akin to a petulant child throwing a tantrum because he wants to eat his dessert before dinner. This is one of the main reasons why so many blacks bristle at the comparison of the two movements -- everybody wants to sing the blues, nobody wants to live them.\r\n\r\nThis lack of perspective is only going to alienate a black community that is still very proud of Obama and is hypersensitive about any criticism of him, especially given he's been in office barely six months.\r\n\r\nIf blacks are less accepting of gays than other racial groups -- and that is certainly debatable -- then the parade of gay people calling Obama a \"disappointment\" on television is counterproductive in gaining acceptance, to say the least. And the fact that the loudest critics are mostly white doesn't help matters either.\r\n\r\nHearing that race matters in the gay community may not be comforting to hear, but that doesn't make it any less true", "982": "Springfield", "983": "Miley Stewart", "984": "Sania Mirza", "985": "the loss", "986": "first", "987": "Democratic Congress", "988": "John Neumar Sr.", "989": "Catherine Zeta-Jones will make her Broadway debut in Stephen Sondheim's \"A Little Night", "990": "The rescue crews believe two other people may be alive under wreckage nearby", "991": "an investigation of its parent company", "992": "March 2004", "993": "India", "994": "an emotional Kiley Barnes, the judge's daughter.\r\n\r\nShe said her father raised her from age 2 and \"made it his life's work to conquer becoming a single parent.\"\r\n\r\nShe recalled her father asking her to bring him her Barbie doll and show him how to create pigtails on either side of her head, and said the judge once literally gave the shirt off his back to a man at a Christmas party after the man complimented him on it.\r\n\r\nShe said her father shared his passion for the law with her, and she remembered how proud he was at her college graduation, as she was one step closer to becoming a lawyer.\r\n\r\nKiley Barnes said she was hoping that after Nichols' conviction, she would feel better because justice had been done.\r\n\r\n\"Instead, I feel as heartbroken and as lonely as I did on March 11, 2005,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBrandau's daughter, Christina Scholte Greenway, was an 18-year-old college freshman at the time of the shootings.

I am proud to be there to represent them today.\n\nAfter almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.\n\nAfter 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.\n\nBlackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.\n\nAt the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.\n\nThe areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.\n\nAny incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.\n\nIn doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.\n\nBlackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.\n\nThe company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented.\n\nThe worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards.\n\nIn Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force.

And he knows how lucky he is to be alive.\r\n\r\n\"My mate Jimmy went up the beach with two cases of bombs. I never saw him again. If I hadn't been hit, who's to say I wouldn't have been in the same position as he was when he was killed?\"\r\n\r\nWith bullet wounds to his chest and arm, Tuckwell collapsed unconscious on the beach. It was more than nine hours later that he was picked up by the stretcher-bearers.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, he was back fighting within six weeks.  Watch Tuckwell tell his story \u00bb\r\n\r\nSo much time has passed since then, but the pain is still etched into his face.\r\n\r\nSitting there in full military uniform, blazer adorned with half a dozen medals, his voice frequently cracks with emotion.\r\n\r\nHe frequently tails off as he relives the past. \"Every time I go back to Normandy I go to his grave, and it brings a tear to me eye even now. We were going do so much after the war ... but it never happened.\"\r\n\r\nTuckwell, who saw action with the 1st Battalion, Dorset Regiment, has since formed a close friendship with Frank Rosier; they are members of the Normandy Veterans Association.\r\n\r\nBoth men say their experiences were so commonplace among their generation that none were able to talk about it until 40 years later.\r\n\r\nRosier told me that what he and the veterans discuss among themselves is very different to what is said in television interviews; but when pushed, he describes what it's like to kill another man.\r\n\r\n\"We could never get our fathers to talk about the first World War, because they were involved in close combat. And twice in the second World War it happened to me.\r\n\r\n\"I came face to face with a German, and I beat him to the draw. I killed him. I sat on the grass and was sick and I cried ... he was some mother's son.\"\r\n\r\nI get the sense that there was a great deal of respect between these soldiers and the Germans on the other side.\r\n\r\nYounger generations try to relate to the scale and the carnage of D-Day through movies like \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\r\n\r\nThe veterans talk of the noise, \"big battleships firing, rocket ships firing, mortars landing, planes strafing, floating artillery and the Germans were totally unsociable about it, they were firing back at us, so there was a hell of a lot of noise there,\" recalls Rosier.\r\n\r\nThey are lighthearted at times, citing the fact that British troops are renowned for their humor -- even in the darkest hours. But it is impossible to gloss over the horror and the danger they faced.\r\n\r\nStanding together in one of the landing crafts at the D-Day museum in Portsmouth, England, Rosier described what it was like to approach Gold beach.  Watch Rosier's full interview \u00bb\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the bullets thundering into the sides of the craft, a ramp on one side hitting a mine and being disabled, and the knowledge that when the front ramp was dropped, the troops inside would be peppered with machine gun fire.\r\n\r\nHe and his infantry were lucky that day - making it onto the beach with minimal loss. But as he told me later, of the 800 men in his infantry, only five survived the war unharmed, \"the rest were killed, missing or wounded.\"\r\n\r\nRosier, who fought with the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, bears the visible scars of battle. He lost an eye to a shrapnel wound -- a 'Blighty one,' meaning that he was taken home to recover in Britain -- and has had to live with the psychological trauma of facial disfigurement.\r\n\r\nBut it's the pain of the ones they left behind that hurts the most.\r\n\r\n\"There was no time to mourn, you didn't have time to mourn,\" said Tuckwell", "1167": "Second Amendment,\" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a news conference Wednesday", "1168": "high mortality rate among Peruvian indigenous women", "1169": "15 months.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of preliminary figures by Japan's Cabinet Office comes after France and Germany surprised economists last week by posting 0.3 percent growth for the second quarter of the year.\r\n\r\nThe news that Japan has rebounded -- the hardest hit of the major economies because of its reliance on exports -- gives economists cautious optimism that the worst of the global recession is over.\r\n\r\n\"The economy has seen a bottoming out of global demand, which has pushed out net exports ... especially in high tech industries and basic materials, such as chemical, steel and so on because of Chinese demand,\" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist in Japan for Credit Suisse.\r\n\r\nJapan's GDP grew just under 1 percent during the three-month period and trade increased 1.6 percent.\r\n\r\nThe uptick marks the end of the worst recession in Japan since the end of World War II", "1170": "The United State", "1171": "the organization does have confidential files", "1172": "Tuesday", "1173": "Olson", "1174": "Darwin Harbor", "1175": "Pierre Balthazard", "1176": "Tuesday", "1177": "1,200", "1178": "her son's written statement", "1179": "the greater the exposure to radiation", "1180": "morning", "1181": "treasure chest", "1182": "Alex Ferguson", "1183": "the government", "1184": "cease-fire breach", "1185": "Wednesday", "1186": "Morelia", "1187": "Monday", "1188": "the Soviets", "1189": "2008", "1190": "U.S.", "1191": "spring high tides", "1192": "mid-30s", "1193": "south coast of Honshu, Japan", "1194": "Infantino's \"SlingRider", "1195": "cancer", "1196": "Saturday Night Live", "1197": "City of Gold", "1198": "thrift store", "1199": "killings of the human-rights workers an assassination", "1200": "down to the efforts of all our people, who never give up.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Now we have to continue working like this, to improve the car so that it is competitive at all the circuits we will encounter.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari fined as Alonso denies Massa in Hockenheim controversy\r\r\n\r\r\nMontezemolo said the move was common practice within the Italian team.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I simply reaffirm what I have always maintained, which is that our drivers are very well aware, and it is something they have to stick to, that if one races for Ferrari, then the interests of the team come before those of the individual,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In any case, these things have happened since the days of [1930s driver Tazio] Nuvolari, and I experienced it myself when I was sporting director, in the days of Niki Lauda and not just then.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAlonso's win put the two-time world champion back into contention for this year's title.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe 29-year-old is now within 34 points of championship leader Lewis Hamilton of McLaren while Massa, who finished second on Sunday, remains eighth with eight races left.\r\r\n\r\r\nAlonso, who also won in Bahrain, secured his second win of the F1 calendar after Massa let him pass shortly after receiving a coded message by race engineer Rob Smedley via his car radio.\r\r\n\r\r\nSmedley was heard saying to Massa: \"Alonso is faster than you.

In 2008, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, this country's highest civilian honor.\r\n\r\nHaving come up from the streets of Detroit, Michigan, to receiving an award at the White House, Carson, 56, works to spread his gospel of education and hard work to motivate others.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife, Candy, started a scholarship foundation to help children with strong academics and humanitarian qualities to pay for college.\r\n\r\n\"I have at least 100,000 letters from kids and adults from around the world ... telling me how it changed their lives,\" Carson said. Their tales of transformations and redemption inspire him to keep talking about educational empowerment and overcoming adversity, he said.\r\n\r\nAn obstacle is a hurdle, and \"you jump over it,\" Carson said.  \"Every time you see a hurdle, you jump over it, and it strengthens you for the next one. And if that's the case, you lead a victorious life, because whatever comes before you, you know you're going to get around it.\"\r\n\r\nCarson was raised in Detroit, majored in psychology at Yale University and attended medical school at the University of Michigan, where he studied neurosurgery.\r\n\r\nCarson's life has been told through plays, books and movies, including a TNT made-for-TV movie called \"Gifted Hands,\" which airs Saturday. (TNT is part of Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN.) The biopic stars Academy Award winner Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carson.\r\n\r\n\"I think he's an angel, a gift from God,\"  Gooding said. \"He has touched a lot of people's lives.\"\r\n\r\nCarson holds more than 50 honorary doctorates and hundreds of other awards.

She didn't make excuses, and she didn't accept excuses,\" Carson said.\r\n\r\nShe turned off the TV, sent Carson and his brother to the library and made them write weekly book reports. Meanwhile, she worked several jobs to support her two sons. She is now 80 and lives with Carson in Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n\r\nWhen Carson was young, he was influenced by stories about Booker T. Washington, a former slave who taught himself to read and later advised presidents, and the biblical character Joseph, who persevered though his brothers sold him into slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Those kinds of stories had an impact on me and helped me to believe it's not where you started, it's where you end that counts. And you have a whole lot to do with that,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody has problems. They just come in different forms. If that problem for you becomes a containing fence, then you become a victim. Once you think you're a victim, you are one, and you're not going anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way, Carson's biography has resonated with people like 22-year-old Douglas Nivens II of Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n\r\nNivens' mother was killed when he was 4 years old, and his father was imprisoned for her murder. His aunt raised him, and he endured relentless teasing for his interest in academics while attending public schools in Baltimore City. During middle school, Nivens picked up Carson's autobiography, \"Gifted Hands,\" and immediately identified with it.\r\n\r\n\"It was a relief to see someone grew up in the city and didn't have a luxurious life but overcame it all,\" he said. \"I love stories about underdogs, those who overcome adversity and do something.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was in middle school, Nivens won two $1,000 scholarships from the Carson Scholars Fund, which helps children with strong academics pay for college.\r\n\r\n\"When it came to times of doubt during high school, when I talked to my adviser, they would say, 'You got this award. Not everyone gets it. You're not dumb. You have the tools to be successful in life,' \" Nivens said. \"That's what really helped me in terms of self-esteem and management in high school.\"\r\n\r\nHe graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in May.\r\n\r\n\"I probably should not be where I am,\" said Nivens, a budget analyst for the U.S. Social Security Administration. \"I went to Baltimore public schools.

Multiply that feeling by a million -- make that more than 2.4 million for every O reader -- and you'll know how I've felt over the past year every time I had to shoot a cover for O. If you're a regular subscriber, you'll notice you've not seen a head-to-toe shot all year. Why? Because I didn't want to be seen. \"\r\n\r\nIn 1992 I reached my heaviest, 237 pounds. I was 38. Then, four years ago, I made it a goal to lose weight, and I appeared on the January 2005 cover at a toned 160 pounds. I thought I was finished with the weight battle. I was done. I'd conquered it. I was so sure, I was even cocky. I had the nerve to say to friends who were struggling, \"All you have to do is work out harder and eat less! Get your 10,000 steps in! None of that starchy stuff!\"\r\n\r\nBam! Karma is a bear of a thing.\r\n\r\nSo here I stand, 40 pounds heavier than I was in 2006. (Yes, you're adding correctly; that means the dreaded 2-0-0.) I'm mad at myself. I'm embarrassed. I can't believe that after all these years, all the things I know how to do, I'm still talking about my weight. I look at my thinner self and think, \"How did I let this happen again?\" Oprah.com: How to prevent weight gain relapse\r\n\r\nIt happened slowly. In February 2007, at 53, I started to have some health issues. At first I was unable to sleep for days. My legs started swelling. My weight started creeping up, first 5 pounds, then 10 pounds. I was lethargic and irritable. My internal clock seemed totally out of whack. I began having rushing heart palpitations every time I worked out. Okay, I've never loved daily exercise, but this was different. I actually developed a fear of working out. I was scared that I would pass out. Or worse. I felt as if I didn't know my own body anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter many trips to various doctors, I received a diagnosis. I had hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course didn't make me lose a single pound) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism (a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain). My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must \"learn to embrace hunger\" or I would immediately gain weight. Believe me, no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the struggle I'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over. I felt completely defeated. I thought, \"I give up. I give up. Fat wins.\" All these years I'd had only myself to blame for lack of willpower. Now I had an official, documented excuse.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid diagnosis felt like some kind of prison sentence.

The official said Haqqani militants were behind a series of \"spectacular attacks,\" this summer, including a 20-hour attack on the American Embassy, last month, and an assault on Kabul's InterContinental Hotel, in June, which left at least a dozen people dead.\r\r\n\r\r\nNATO officials said there had also been a marked increase in the number of cross border attacks from Pakistan, but the insisted reports of artillery bombardments and heavy casualties were often exaggerated.\r\r\n\r\r\nInternational Security Assistance Force troops respond to all reports by deploying surveillance assets, usually helicopters and drones, but they often cannot find evidence of structural damage or the craters consistent with the villagers' accounts of sustained artillery and rocket bombardments, the official explained.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe official said ISAF's primary objective is sharing this information with Afghan and Pakistani officials as quickly as possible to diffuse cross-border tensions.

He spoke to CNN.com about being an openly gay actor.\r\n\r\n\"We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,\" says actor Bryan Batt, who is openly gay.\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- There was once a time when the revelation of one's homosexuality in Hollywood was thought to be a career-killer.\r\n\r\nNow, out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine. There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before.\r\n\r\nBut even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal?\r\n\r\nTo shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCNN: Has being openly gay affected your career?\r\n\r\nBatt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles \u00bb\r\n\r\nCNN: When did you come out?\r\n\r\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\r\n\r\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano", "1651": "Tropical Storm Kevin has also emerged in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

Ray Odierno, issued a joint statement expressing sadness over al-Hakim's death and describing him as \"a national leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,\" the statement said. \"We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.\"  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future \u00bb\r\n\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered his condolences, saying al-Hakim was \"like an old brother.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Maliki credited him for being a \"strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq.\"\r\n\r\n\"His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,\" al-Maliki said in the statement.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim ended his more than 20-year exile in Iran in 2003, when he returned to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his regime.\r\n\r\n\"It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,\" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. \"I was longing to see them. My goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them.\"\r\n\r\nIraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return.\r\n\r\nDuring his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHe took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south.\r\n\r\nSCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word \"revolution,\" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man.\r\n\r\nHis political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did.\r\n\r\nGovernment ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad.\r\n\r\nAnd when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence in Iraq, saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government, which raised concerns about what it called Iran's \"meddling.\" He cited the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries' shared border, historical and cultural relations", "1871": "an associate professor at the Carey School of Business", "1872": "Israeli", "1873": "The new \"Footloose", "1874": "shocked the city.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn this case, it turned out that mistaken identity was behind the incident and that the youths killed were innocent.

Chart: Gender and mental health \u00bb\r\n\r\nWhile these statistics are not new, their importance is generally underplayed, says Wanda Jones, Dr.P.H., health scientist and director of the OWH. She notes that whereas past reports have focused on bringing mental health to the forefront of concern -- such as the 1999 publication \"Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General\" -- few have focused primarily on the specific mental illness issues specific to women, hence the need for such a publication.\r\n\r\nAmong the actions recommended by the new report are the needs to underscore the essential importance of women's mental health to overall well-being, improve how primary care doctors and mental health professionals interface with each other, develop a greater understanding in the role of gender in mental illness,  recognize the role of trauma and violence against women and its subsequent impact on mental illness and address cultural biases that serve as barriers to treatment for many women.\r\n\r\nReasons for the gender disparities in mental health are still unclear, according to Jones. Part of the difference is based on biology. Female hormones, thyroid disease and brain biochemistry have all been cited as possible reasons. Genetics also play a part, as family history has proven that mental illness repeats itself across multiple generations. Socio-cultural reasons also contribute to the difference.\r\n\r\nJones stresses that the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to diagnosing and treating mental illness is not an effective approach and that acknowledging the gender differential is key to adequately and appropriately treating women.\r\n\r\nThe new report also underscores the relative young age at which mental illness often sets in for both males and females. Half of all mental illnesses occur before age 14, and three-fourths occur by the age of 24, according to the publication.

Schwarzenegger has called for \"draconian\" spending cuts to deal with a shortfall of nearly $20 billion. The state's public education system has been feeling the pain, and students and teachers are screaming loudly. Last fall, students held a series of protests on the UC Berkeley campus after the announcement last summer of a 32 percent tuition hike throughout the state's university system.\r\r\n\r\r\nThose protests grew into a movement, and Thursday, rallies, marches, demonstrations and teach-ins are scheduled across the state under a \"Day of Action\" banner. There are also protests planned in more than 30 other states to fight further budget cuts, layoffs and furloughs.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhitney Thompson, 23, from Yuma, Arizona, is a \"super-senior\" at Fresno State University. She plans to get her degree in history next fall. She is part of a statewide organization called Students for a Quality Education. Thompson will be speaking Thursday at a rally on the Fresno State campus", "2003": "4 months old, Kaden is a playful, black- and white-coated basenji being schooled at Georgia K9 National Training Center. Once fully trained, he will assist federal and local police officers as well as private corporations in nosing out deadly explosives at schools, airports and public events.\r\n\r\nHis detective skills can potentially save thousands of lives in an era where law enforcement agencies are aggressively fighting against drugs and terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\n\"Think about a scenario like the 1996 Olympic bombings,\" says Kaden's trainer Jeff Schettler, a cheery man who has coached hundreds of dogs to sniff out bombs, drugs, missing people and corpses since the mid-1990s.\r\n\r\nDemand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement. The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S. The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Watch three detection puppies in action \u00bb\r\n\r\nOfficial records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S. In more recent years, police departments realized a dog's nose was a valuable asset.\r\n\r\nDogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others. For each drop of odor detected by a dog, the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000", "2004": "60", "2005": "Saturday", "2006": "unseeded Kirilenko", "2007": "Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy", "2008": "July 7, 2005", "2009": "US Airways Flight 1549", "2010": "the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nErik Prince, CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA, is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional", "2011": "E. coli 0157", "2012": "15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids.\r\n\r\n\"It's not just reading scores,\" she says. \"They start to speak up in class, and volunteer, and finish homework. They don't want to miss school when they're going to read to the dog, so it improves attendance. It kind of just flows over onto everything.\"\r\n\r\nR.E.A.D. staff and volunteers know people are skeptical about the program's results at first, but Klotz says anyone who's spent time", "2013": "plumbing", "2014": "Tyler Perry", "2015": "Andre Greipel", "2016": "The Lord has a reason for putting him in here", "2017": "will be leaving prison", "2018": "Wednesday night", "2019": "seven", "2020": "approximately $1.5 million", "2021": "the head and shoulders of Christ", "2022": "Granddad Bandit", "2023": "Liam Gallagher", "2024": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "2025": "China's giant pandas are believed to be safe after Monday's earthquake", "2026": "Ashura", "2027": "Wednesday by a federal judge", "2028": "When the vehicle was overturning, the roof of the bus split open", "2029": "plagiarism and falsification", "2030": "Greece's credit rating has been slashed twice in the past two weeks", "2031": "Close to one million", "2032": "ABC's morning show", "2033": "graves", "2034": "11", "2035": "American Medical Response in Clackamas County", "2036": "how economically viable will it be to create the sustainable cities of the future", "2037": "Shibuya, Shinjuku and Akihabara", "2038": "The former Spartak Moscow", "2039": "his graying beard", "2040": "Alzheimer", "2041": "first", "2042": "more than 52,000", "2043": "explicit warnings to stay well off the coast of Somalia", "2044": "a \"candidate to bring change to our country", "2045": "Donington Park", "2046": "PARIS", "2047": "John Yettaw", "2048": "more than 40 million", "2049": "the families, Calderon and local political and civic leaders", "2050": "Friday.\r\n\r\nThe new charges caused another delay in the murder case, CNN afiliate KRON reported.\r\n\r\nThe complaint charged that Huckaby \"did willfully and unlawfully mingle a harmful substance with food or drink\" with the intent to harm the child, identified only as \"Jane M.

The mission was to figure out how to train underprivileged young people in green-jobs skills, such as installing solar panels and retrofitting houses to make them more energy efficient.  Watch more on Van Jones' career \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"People talk about global warming. ... I want to cool the Earth down. I also want to calm the block down,\" said Jones.\r\n\r\nJones' efforts earned him national recognition and grabbed the attention of Obama's advisers.\r\n\r\nNow, he is the president's pitchman for green jobs, helping to coordinate government agencies focused on delivering millions of green jobs to the ailing U.S. economy.\r\n\r\n\"I see myself as the green-jobs handyman. My job is to make sure that the president's desire that we have literally millions of green jobs in our country actually turns into reality,\" said Jones.\r\n\r\nYet even in places like Michigan, where unemployment is a whopping 15 percent -- well above the national average of 9.5 percent -- Jones understands there's skepticism about his message.\r\n\r\nCNN followed Jones on a recent visit to Lansing, Michigan, where he told attendees at a green-jobs conference that saving the planet and saving jobs can go hand in hand.\r\n\r\n\"You say, 'Oh no, oh no -- you're gonna talk about the caulking gun. Oh no!' \" Jones joked with the crowd.\r\n\r\nCritics, though, have serious concerns about the \"green collar\" agenda. They argue that those green jobs -- retrofitting homes to make them more energy-efficient, for instance -- will be mostly low-level and low-paying.\r\n\r\nJones dismisses that.\r\n\r\n\"You take somebody and maybe this summer they're putting up solar panels,\" Jones said. \"Well guess what, this is a growing part of our economy -- the next summer they can be a manager, the next summer, maybe they can be an owner, an investor, an inventor.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Jones tries to spread his green message, he's also trying to practice what he preaches. That means taking public transportation, including a bus and train ride, to get to his office just across the street from the White House. He says those rides give him valuable opportunities to hear unvarnished views.\r\n\r\nDescribing his work as a member of the executive branch", "2354": "Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- One-third of Americans have a favorable view of the Tea Party movement, but a plurality has no opinion at all, according to a new national poll.\r\n\r\nA CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey indicates that 26 percent of the public has an unfavorable view of the Tea Party movement and that 4 in 10 have not heard of the movement or don't know enough to form an opinion.

See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research \u00bb\r\n\r\nResearchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body. Stem cells have this ability for a short time. A few days before the embryo would implant in the uterus, it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus.  Watch a doctor explain why embryotic stem cells are so important \u00bb\r\n\r\nWhen the embryo is 4 or 5 days old, scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish. With the removal of these stem cells -- of which there may be about 30 -- the embryo is destroyed.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one of the 60 stem cell lines authorized for research under the Bush policy have proven useful to researchers. Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Bush maintained that scientific advances allowed researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos.\r\n\r\nConservative leaders echoed Bush's rationale in their criticism of Obama's decision.\r\n\r\n\"Advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington, D.C., and breakthroughs announced in recent years confirm the full potential of stem cell research can be realized without the destruction of living human embryos,\" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Sunday.\r\n\r\nSen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, said the Bush policy imposed proper ethical limits on science.\r\n\r\n\"My basic tenet here is I don't think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth,\" Shelby said Sunday. \"I know that people argue there are other ways. I think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can, but we should have some ethics about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe issue of whether to lift the ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research has, however, exposed a clear rift between the more moderate and conservative factions of the GOP.\r\n\r\nIn February, a group of six moderate GOP congressmen sent a letter to Obama urging him to lift the funding ban.\r\n\r\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan also issued a statement Monday thanking Obama for lifting the ban.\r\n\r\n\"These new rules will now make it possible for scientists to move forward,\" Reagan said. \"Countless people, suffering from many different diseases, stand to benefit from the answers stem cell research can provide. We owe it to ourselves and to our children to do everything in our power to find cures for these diseases.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after leaving office -- an affliction that many scientists say eventually may be cured with the help of embryonic stem cell research.\r\n\r\nObama's presidential memorandum, however, may turn out to have a broader impact than his executive order.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum is expected to create a clear change of tone from the Bush administration on a broad range of scientific issues.\r\n\r\nBush's critics argued the former president allowed political factors improperly to influence funding decisions for science initiatives", "2525": "morning rush hour", "2526": "Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- One-third of Americans have a favorable view of the Tea Party movement, but a plurality has no opinion at all, according to a new national poll.\r\n\r\nA CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey indicates that 26 percent of the public has an unfavorable view of the Tea Party movement and that 4 in 10 have not heard of the movement or don't know enough to form an opinion.

By this I mean that calling someone racist is a taboo, not racism itself.\r\n\r\nSo when Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich and several other conservative commentators call a sitting federal appeals court judge and Supreme Court nominee who happens to be Latina, a racist, it's time to push back. Real hard.\r\n\r\nThe evidence offered in support of Judge Sonia Sotomayor's alleged racism is a speech she gave in Berkeley, California, in honor of Judge Mario G. Olmos, a former judge, community leader and graduate of Boalt Hall Law School who died an untimely death at the age of 43.\r\n\r\nThe offending section of the speech is this: \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\" This passage inspired Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives and potential 2012 presidential candidate, to call Judge Sotomayor \"a Latina racist.\"\r\n\r\nTo lift one statement out of Judge Sotomayor's eight-page speech without examining the context and substance of her remarks, is an example of the kind of shoddy character assassination that I suspect will dominate this judicial confirmation process.\r\n\r\nJudge Sotomayor's speech is, in fact, an excellent meditation on how the experiences of judges might affect how they approach aspects of judicial decision-making. It explores the important, and too-little examined reality that judicial deliberations can be affected by a judge's background, perspective and experience.\r\n\r\nIn the next sentence immediately following the passage above, Judge Sotomayor says, \"Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice [Benjamin] Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society.\"\r\n\r\nCould she have been referring to Buck v. Bell, the 1927 case in which Justice Holmes -- widely regarded as perhaps the most brilliant justice in the Supreme Court's history -- upheld the state's plan to sterilize Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old white woman, who was accused of being congenitally retarded. Buck's main crime seems to have been the fact that she'd had a child out of wedlock.\r\n\r\nIn any case, Justice Holmes upheld the sterilization order, emphatically and coldly stating, \"three generations of imbeciles is enough.\" Does anyone seriously believe that a woman, and especially a woman of color \"with the richness of her experiences\" would not have \"reach[ed] a better conclusion \" than that adopted by Justice Holmes in 1927?\r\n\r\nIn fact Buck v. Bell is the perfect example of how a \"wise old [white] man\" got it wrong in a way that a woman judge or a racial minority most likely would not.\r\n\r\nIt's worth pointing out that in that same speech Judge Sotomayor cautioned, \"we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group.\" But she acknowledges that \"there may be some [difference in her judging] based on my gender and my Latina heritage.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Gingrich and others decry in Judge Sotomayor should be applauded. Judge Sotomayor has the humility to recognize the difficulty of achieving true and pure impartiality. Instead, as she pointed out in her speech, \"[t]he aspiration to impartiality is just that -- it's an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike so many judges who by virtue of being white and male simply assume their impartiality, Judge Sotomayor recognizes that all judges are affected by their background and their life experiences.\r\n\r\nIronically, it was Justice Cardozo who recognized this when he said, \"[t]he great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men, do not turn aside in their course, and pass the judge by.\" Justice Cardozo concluded that \"[n]o effort or revolution of the mind will overthrow utterly and at all times the empire of ... [a judge's] subconscious loyalties.\r\n\r\nThese are the realities of judicial decision-making evoked by Judge Sotomayor's speech. It's perhaps easier to say as [then-Supreme Court nominee] Clarence Thomas so famously did, that a judge can simply, \"strip down like a runner,\" and become utterly impartial simply by putting on a black robe. But it is more honest to acknowledge that regardless of race, gender, ideology or professional background, impartiality is always a work-in-progress for judges.\r\n\r\nEven Judge Richard Posner, a conservative stalwart on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals once observed that, \"Litigation commonly involves persons at different social distances form the judge, and the more proximate will garner the more sympathetic response regardless of actual desert.\"\r\n\r\nJustice Thomas is the perfect example of how hard it can be for a judge to lay aside the personal experiences that shape his worldview. His views about the affirmative action cases that come before him are shaped quite clearly by what he regards as the self-sufficient dignity of his hard-working grandfather and the humiliation he says he felt when others believed his scholarly accomplishments were the result of affirmative action.\r\n\r\nWhite judges are also shaped by their background and experiences. They needn't ever speak of it, simply because their whiteness and gender insulates them from the presumption of partiality and bias that is regularly attached to women judges and judges of color when it comes to matters of race and gender.\r\n\r\nOnly a judge who is conscious and fully engaged with the reality of how her experiences may bear on her approach to the facts of a case, or sense of social justice, or vision of constitutional interpretation, should be entrusted to sit on the most influential and powerful court in our nation.\r\n\r\nToo often we have allowed ourselves to be placated and charmed by fantasies about umpire judges calling \"balls and strikes,\" without ever asking which league the game is being played in or whether the umpire was standing in the best position to see the play. We forget that when deciding whether a batter checked his swing, the homeplate umpire will routinely ask for the alternative perspective from the first or third base umpire before calling a \"swing and a miss\" a strike.\r\n\r\nJudge Sotomayor rightly suggests that these things matter. She notes in her speech that \"personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see.\" She should know this. She's been a trial judge. None of the other justices who will serve with Judge Sotomayor will have had that experience.\r\n\r\nJudge Sotomayor's speech is one of the most honest and compelling statements about judicial impartiality we're likely to hear from a judge of her stature.\r\n\r\nIt ends with this humble observation:\r\n\r\n\"Each day on the bench I learn something new about the judicial process and about being a professional Latina woman in a world that sometimes looks at me with suspicion. I am reminded each day that I render decisions that affect people concretely and that I owe them constant and complete vigilance in checking my assumptions, presumptions and perspectives and ensuring that to the extent that my limited abilities and capabilities permit me, that I re-evaluate them and change as circumstances and cases before me requires. I can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my experiences, but I accept my limitations. I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage but attempt, as the Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are appropriate.\"\r\n\r\nIt's entirely appropriate to question Judge Sotomayor about this speech at her confirmation hearings.

Tobin responded with a statement Sunday followed by his television appearance Monday, in which he acknowledged holding Kennedy to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy.\r\n\r\nThe issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men. A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House.\r\n\r\nKennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language.\r\n\r\nRequests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion \"a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions. He acknowledged \"a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion.\"\r\n\r\nOther Catholics questioned Tobin's stance.\r\n\r\n\"The simple fact is that most bishops don't want to deny communion to politicians, and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II gave communion to pro-choice Italian politicians,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University. \"So the question is, is Bishop Tobin more Catholic than the pope on this?\"\r\n\r\nPoliticians have previously run afoul of Catholic bishops on the abortion issue. Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann asked Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to stop receiving communion when she was a pro-choice governor of Kansas, and former St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke said in 2004 he would deny communion to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for being pro-choice.\r\n\r\nBrian McLaren, a longtime Christian pastor who has written a book coming out next year called \"A New Kind of Christianity,\" said politicizing religious views limits the perception and, eventually, the impact of a church's teachings.\r\n\r\n\"Both Catholics and Protestants have allowed themselves to be pushed into this kind of binary, either-or thinking\" on abortion and homosexuality, McLaren said. \"It's disturbing for me as a non-Catholic to see the Catholic Church possibly risking its moral authority on a number of other issues by only focusing on abortion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic church", "2594": "state-run", "2595": "Indonesia", "2596": "The e-mail was posted on a Web site of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility", "2597": "Camp Bucca, which is in southern Iraq near the Kuwaiti border", "2598": "Iraqi militants holding Krause and her son hostage demanded that Germany withdraw its troops from Afghanistan", "2599": "Suleman pay her bills", "2600": "the entertainer", "2601": "Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio", "2602": "Omid Mir Sayafi", "2603": "Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev", "2604": "Eric Holder's discussion of race in America", "2605": "not corrupt", "2606": "Steny Hoyer", "2607": "disturbing the peace and resisting arrest", "2608": "the van drove in an attempt", "2609": "Saudi counterparts", "2610": "Botswana Defence Force", "2611": "the Vatican", "2612": "the House Education and Labor Committee", "2613": "$72.5 million", "2614": "Tuesday's Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev", "2615": "0.02 percent", "2616": "Friday", "2617": "This is a small incremental step", "2618": "Livingstone Chipadze", "2619": "al Qaeda's top strategists", "2620": "1981", "2621": "20", "2622": "first-time", "2623": "the roof of the bus split open", "2624": "the Normandy Invasion or \"D-Day landings", "2625": "third", "2626": "The global monitor", "2627": "first two years only on the AT&T system", "2628": "England's congestion zone on weekdays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.\r\r\n\r\r\nUnited Kingdom \u2022 On weekdays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., London charges a fee to enter the city's congestion zone", "2629": "349,000", "2630": "Wednesday, Kashmir's Indian-appointed governor N.

There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before.\r\n\r\nBut even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal?\r\n\r\nTo shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nCNN: Has being openly gay affected your career?\r\n\r\nBatt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles \u00bb\r\n\r\nCNN: When did you come out?\r\n\r\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\r\n\r\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go.

It has cited concern \"about possible attacks by extremist individuals or groups against U.S. citizens, facilities, businesses and perceived interests.\"\r\n\r\nThe State Department ordered the departure of all non-emergency American staff from the Embassy, along with their family members, in April, after attacks against the Embassy and a residential compound.

It's a program run by volunteers and city officials in conjunction with Magdalene House, a nonprofit that works to get prostitutes off the streets.\r\n\r\n\"Prostitution doesn't discriminate,\" said Kenny Baker, a cognitive behavioral therapist who is the program's director. \"Most of these men don't have a prior criminal history, so our goal is to help these folks understand why they put themselves in a bad position, to prevent it from happening again.\"\r\n\r\nSet in a church in Nashville, Tennessee, the John School is led by former prostitutes, health experts, psychologists and law enforcement officers who talk to -- and at times berate -- the men about the risks of hiring a prostitute.\r\n\r\nProstitution is based on the law of supply and demand. The thinking is: Women won't stop selling sex until men stop buying.\r\n\r\nSo Nashville and a growing number of cities are shifting their focus from locking up suppliers to educating buyers. Across the country, about 50 communities are using John Schools. Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore, Maryland, are among dozens more cities that plan to launch similar programs by the end of the year.  See where the John Schools are \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"It will make them [offenders] see that this is not a victimless crime, and they are contributing to the exploitation of women,\" said Stephanie Davis, policy adviser on women's issues at the mayor's office in Atlanta. \"It's hurting them, the man, and it's hurting their families and its hurting the community.\"\r\n\r\nNo comprehensive effort has been made to track the numbers, but experts estimate 1 million to 2 million prostitutes work in the United States. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Report lists about 78,000 arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice, but experts say those numbers are extremely conservative because many sex workers and johns aren't caught.\r\n\r\nExperts add that easy accessibility to prostitutes and pornography on the Internet", "2696": "Fabian Cancellara", "2697": "parent company", "2698": "Nine people were killed and 19 injured after a tour bus carrying people on a ski trip left a highway and rolled over Sunday night", "2699": "Robert Gates", "2700": "Roland Martin", "2701": "120 seconds", "2702": "yo-yo", "2703": "space-age topography", "2704": "Capt.

I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead.\r\n\r\nThe rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition.\r\n\r\nThen there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards.\r\n\r\nThe story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging.\r\n\r\nUltimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\"\r\n\r\nSorry, Rick, I disagree.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control.\r\n\r\nRunning with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nIn one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives", "2765": "CNN.com: So what do the Democrats need to do to win the White House", "2766": "Thursday", "2767": "can sympathize", "2768": "YANGON, Myanmar (CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and an American man who swam to her lakeside home went on trial in the military dictatorship Monday behind closed doors inside a prison compound.\r\n\r\nSoldiers guard the entrance to Insein Prison on Monday in Yangon, Myanmar.\r\n\r\nThe trial is expected to last about three months, said Nyan Win, spokesman for her National League for Democracy party.\r\n\r\nSuu Kyi's lawyer asked the court to open up the hearings but was turned down because of security concerns, Win said.\r\n\r\nPolice put up roadblocks on the streets leading to the Insean Prison near Yangon", "2769": "Sunday as the country investigated alleged Pakistani ties", "2770": "It's a less deferential, less hierarchical place", "2771": "the FDA said it has \"some concern", "2772": "Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi", "2773": "14-ton bell", "2774": "soon start selling a program that will allow iPhone owners to use the hugely popular device on cell phone systems around the world", "2775": "a month", "2776": "riding up front", "2777": "Birk", "2778": "Al-Sadr", "2779": "Ahmed Shafiq", "2780": "Benjamin Wallen, self-proclaimed biggest fan of HBO's \"The Wire,\" thought it was well worth a $300 flight home to watch the highly anticipated series finale of the acclaimed crime drama with his best friends -- and fellow series diehards -- Sunday night.\r\n\r\nThe finale of \"The Wire\" has raised intense interest -- all the more so because it's not available on demand.\r\n\r\nThough the season finale is not scheduled to air nationally until Sunday, HBO has made episodes of the series available through certain cable providers' on-demand feature up to a week before their national air dates.\r\n\r\nBut when Wallen and his friends huddled around the television and switched on the cable box at 12:03 a.m. Monday, their hearts sank: The new episode wasn't listed.

People who don't use their real names are found to be out of compliance with Facebook's rules and can have their accounts deactivated.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way,\" Facebook's terms of service document says.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie's situation shows how difficult it can be for people to prove who they are. He submitted his passport to Facebook, he wrote, and still had problems.\r\r\n\r\r\nSupporters of democratic protests in the Middle East and elsewhere have criticized Facebook and other social networks like Google+ for their real-name policies, saying they prevent people from organizing against authoritarian governments that could use a network like Facebook to crack down.\r\r\n\r\r\nIf they could use pseudonyms, they would be safer, some say.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There are myriad reasons why individuals may wish to use a name other than the one they were born with,\" Jillian York wrote on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's blog in July. \"They may be concerned about threats to their lives or livelihoods, or they may risk political or economic retribution. They may wish to prevent discrimination or they may use a name that's easier to pronounce or spell in a given culture.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFacebook always has maintained its position as an \"identity network.\" A core philosophy of the site is that people should be themselves -- and should be accountable for their posts with their real names.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie's case shows how tricky enforcement can be, though.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is the sort of thing that makes you wonder what real names policy is all about,\" Alexis Madrigal wrote on The Atlantic's website.

Thursday's report said the Davis case exposed the deep concerns over the death penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972, when the (Supreme) Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases,\" the report said.\r\r\n\r\r\nA CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in October found that for the first time in recent memory, more Americans favor a sentence of life in prison over the death penalty for murderers -- 50% to 48%.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat's not to say that Americans want to abolish the death penalty entirely.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther polls have shown majorities generally favor it, but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said his analysis shows there is a difference between thinking the government should have the death penalty as an option and actually wanting to see it applied.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe decline in the number who prefer the death penalty as the punishment for murder may be related to the growing number who believe that at least one person in the past five years has been executed for a crime that he or she did not commit.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 2005, when a solid majority preferred the death penalty, 59% believed that an innocent person had been executed within the previous five years. Now that figure has risen dramatically, to 72%.\r\r\n\r\r\nDavis drew widespread support for his claims that an innocent man was being put to death, after federal and state courts had rejected his calls for a new trial.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince Davis' conviction in 1991, seven of the nine witnesses against him recanted their testimony, and no physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of a Savannah police officer. However, a federal judge concluded the death row inmate \"vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nA Texas execution in July also attracted international attention. Mexican national Humberto Leal Garcia was convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl. A world court found the state violated his rights by not giving Leal access to his home country's consulate upon his arrest in 1994, as required by an international treaty. U.S. and Mexican officials, along with a variety of human rights groups, urged Texas to delay the execution, but to no avail.\r\r\n\r\r\nTexas continues to lead the nation as the busiest death penalty state, with 13 executions this year. Alabama was next with six, and Ohio with five. No more are scheduled until next month.\r\r\n\r\r\nThirty-four states have capital laws, but only 13 states carried out that ultimate punishment in 2011. In addition, several states with capital punishment laws did not sentence anyone to death in 2011, including Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and South Carolina.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnother high-profile murder convict in Pennsylvania saw his death sentence commuted. Prosecutors decided this month not to give Mumia Abu-Jamal a new capital sentencing hearing. He was convicted of murdering Philadelphia police office Daniel Faulkner, but has long claimed his innocence as a victim of what he called a racist criminal justice system. He will spend the rest of his life in prison.\r\r\n\r\r\nCalifornia", "2957": "Turkish state news agency Anadolu", "2958": "Prime Minister Gordon Brown", "2959": "cried years of tears", "2960": "Anwar al-Awlaki", "2961": "9 a.m. at the Columbia Farms poultry processing plant", "2962": "the White House", "2963": "stabbed", "2964": "Monday", "2965": "Wednesday", "2966": "The nearly 100", "2967": "two", "2968": "at least a dozen", "2969": "The bakery", "2970": "Fourth", "2971": "250", "2972": "Sunday", "2973": "Christopher Kelly", "2974": "abolish capital punishment under current realities and social security conditions", "2975": "Belgium", "2976": "State Department Women of Courage Awards", "2977": "the Jackson 5", "2978": "the Army's Inspector General to begin an investigation into allegations regarding cemetery operations", "2979": "Beijing's 2008 Olympic Games, he became a symbol of the youth and future of China.

The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend.\r\n\r\n\"We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,\" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. \"It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paranormal Activity\" bills itself as \"the first-ever major film release demanded by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors. But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly", "3084": "increase,\" Dr. Eric Laroche, a WHO official in Harare, told CNN on Wednesday. \"I think it's going to last for several months.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the WHO, the Red Cross has responded to the outbreak and is sending staff and medical supplies into Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nZimbabwe's main hospitals have all but shut down and the small clinics equipped by international aid organizations are overcrowded and unable to cope with the thousands of cholera patients. Health workers inside Zimbabwe believe scores are dying at home.\r\n\r\nLaroche said the WHO is receiving cooperation from the government, but the health care system is abysmal.\r\n\r\n\"The quality of the care, the supplies that come inside Zimbabwe, also need to be restored,\" Laroche said. \"So there's a lot of work to do, because the health system is collapsing for the time being.\"\r\n\r\nOne Zimbabwean health care worker, who would not show his face on the video, said he fears the death toll will skyrocket.\r\n\r\n\"People are dying even at the health institution,\" he said. \"It's beyond control.

He received a medical school education, obtained hormones -- relatively new substances that were poorly understood at the time, and independently began living as a man in the early 1940s.\r\n\r\nEventually, he found a plastic surgeon to help him, and his physical changes were complete by 1949, but his family rejected him. The British tabloids hounded him. To escape publicity, he was forced to carve out a life for himself virtually alone. He became a Buddhist monk, and died in Tibet in 1962 at the age of 47.\r\n\r\nHis name was Michael Dillon, and he one of the Western world's first transsexual people, that is, someone who changes sex and/or gender by medical means. His extensive writings were suppressed and destroyed by his family -- only fragments survive.\r\n\r\nBy 1988, when I began my transition (just before my 40th birthday), there was scarcely more information about female-to-male transsexualism available than there was in 1949. Even in the early 1990s, doctors told transsexual people that we should not socialize together, because people might notice there were things about us that were different from \"normal\" people.\r\n\r\nMany transsexual women were tall and some had broad shoulders, large hands and feet. Most transsexual men were on the short side, and had small hands and feet. It's one thing if you mix in with other people where there is a lot of physical diversity, but if you congregate with others like you, you may risk discovery.\r\n\r\nTo be discovered as a transsexual person was a horrible fate. And fitting in, being \"normal,\" was the goal of treatment, after all. I was convinced that having a \"sex change\" was going to be a very straightforward process. I would take the hormones, have some surgery, and then go home and mow my lawn. I expected life to just be ordinary, just the way it was supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThere were a few surprises in store for me, though, not the least of which was that I learned that the fear and shame of being known or discovered to be a transsexual person was probably responsible for a tremendous amount of suffering.\r\n\r\nI learned that people like me hid themselves from the world, often were under-employed or unemployed, avoided seeing physicians when they were ill, and often expected that they would never have intimate partners.\r\n\r\nAfter I began transition, I met more and more transsexual men like myself, and I saw firsthand the fear and shame that limited their lives. These were kind, gentle, thoughtful, serious men, and they did not deserve to live in a state of fear and shame.\r\n\r\nI knew then that education about who we were, and what our lives were like, would be absolutely necessary to do two things: first to let people like me know we were not alone and we didn't have to be afraid; and second to let other people know we existed, to make the world safe for us, for our difference and our uniqueness.\r\n\r\nLike a handful of other trans men in North America, Europe, England, and Japan, I began to do public education, to write about our experience, and to educate legislators and policy makers, helping them change the laws, hoping to ease the suffering of others like ourselves who would follow in our footsteps.\r\n\r\nAnd now Chaz Bono announces his transition through his publicist.

Watch Obama pay tribute to McCain \u00c2\u00bb\n\nEarly voting totals in the East suggested things would go traditionally, with McCain taking most of the Southeast, Obama most of the Northeast.\n\nBut then things quickly changed, as the senator from Illinois struck -- first in Pennsylvania and then in the Midwest state of Ohio, states McCain had to win in his bid for the Oval Office. Obama then delivered an uppercut in Virginia, a state that had not voted for a Democratic president since 1964. See your state's county-by-county totals\n\nAs polls closed from East to West, Obama kept hammering McCain, as he snatched away Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada -- states that had been in President Bush's column in 2004.\n\nAnd Wednesday morning, Obama added Indiana to the list of states he'd turned from red to blue. Indiana hadn't voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.\n\n(Missouri and North Carolina were still counting votes Wednesday, but it appeared one or two of them could become blue-state converts as well.)\n\nWith McCain on the ropes, an Obama victory in Florida sounded the death knell.

Ending on this \"what happens now\" cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise's history.\r\n\r\nBut of bigger concern, of course, is that \"The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last. And that's thanks to Josh Friedman, the inspired executive producer.\r\n\r\nFor him, \"Terminator\" isn't about special effects and metal monsters. It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost.\r\n\r\nWithout clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified.\r\n\r\nIt's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in? Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real-life battle against cancer.\r\n\r\nFans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah (Lena Headey) in the new reality. Did she follow her son into the future? If not, what happened to her?\r\n\r\nFriedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now. He packs episodes with twists you don't see coming but make sense in retrospect. He changes up his style, drops lead characters for entire episodes, uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that's simultaneously believable and eloquent. He lets major characters die. And the show's directors coax subtle, nuanced performances from the actors.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't guess any of this from Fox's promotions, which have focused too heavily on Cameron (Summer Glau), the robot who helps protect John Connor (Thomas Dekker), sending the signal that it's a show just for teenage fanboys. Cameron and John's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize: the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life. It's in some ways the reverse of \"Buffy.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Fox may have done better promoting \"Chronicles\" as a family drama and then pairing it with one, rather than \"Dollhouse,\" the latest from \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon. (Insider question for fans: Is Josh Friedman the new Joss Whedon? Weigh in here or here.)\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear how, or if, the new movie \"Terminator: Salvation\" affects the show's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines, there's apparently no overlap and no conflict.\r\n\r\nThe weekly adventures of Sarah and John Connor just aren't done.

The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko", "3232": "October 1991", "3233": "Sunday night.\r\n\r\nThe finale of \"The Wire\" has raised intense interest -- all the more so because it's not available on demand.\r\n\r\nThough the season finale is not scheduled to air nationally until Sunday, HBO has made episodes of the series available through certain cable providers' on-demand feature up to a week before their national air dates.\r\n\r\nBut when Wallen and his friends huddled around the television and switched on the cable box at 12:03 a.m. Monday, their hearts sank: The new episode wasn't listed.

Much of the discarded electronic kit contains tiny -- but valuable -- quantities of aluminum, copper, cadmium and other minerals, all of which can be sold on, if they can be recovered.\r\n\r\nHowever they also contain highly toxic materials, which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers.\r\n\r\n\"People living and working on and around the dump sites, many of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health, including cancer, damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children,\" Kim Schoppink, Toxics Campaigner at Greenpeace, told CNN.\r\n\r\n\"The open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins.\"\r\n\r\nNo studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in Nigeria, but in 2008 a Greenpeace report on similar dumps in nearby Ghana confirmed that high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon.\r\n\r\nA Chinese academic report published in \"Environmental Health Perspectives\" in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby.\r\n\r\nThere is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for \"e-waste\" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nSome of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 a Greenpeace study, \"Not in My Backyard\", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\r\n\r\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\r\n\r\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\r\n\r\nIt's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading.\r\n\r\nThe volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste.\r\n\r\nEach one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years.\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market.\r\n\r\n\"Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,\" said Schoppink.\r\n\r\n\"It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem.\r\n\r\n\"The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it.

Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel.\r\r\n\r\r\nYet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes.

Winds that complicated efforts to fight the spill died down Tuesday, making cleanup work easier, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's a gift of a little bit of time,\" she told reporters. \"But I'm not resting.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe spill threatens wildlife, beaches and livelihoods along the Gulf Coast. Already federal officials have banned fishing in the affected area until at least May 12, curtailing a commercial seafood industry that brings in about $2.4 billion to the region every year. The leading edge of the slick was reported to be lapping at the edge of Louisiana's Chandeleur Islands early Tuesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Let's make no mistake about what's at stake here. This is our very way of life,\" Jindal told reporters. \"This is our fishing communities, these are some of our coastal communities. We're talking about keeping this oil out of our fragile wetlands.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut as of mid-afternoon, no oil had been found washed up on the islands, said Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP, which owns the damaged well.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"To give you a sense of our ability to respond, we launched 22 vessels,\" Suttles told reporters at a news conference in Mobile, Alabama. Twelve of those vessels were shrimp boats whose skippers have volunteered to assist in the cleanup, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They've been in the area ever since trying to locate that oil and make sure it actually doesn't reach shore,\" Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe edge of the slick was reported to be about 20 miles off the Mississippi Coast, and Landry said it was about 30 miles off the shores of Alabama. Suttles said BP workers expected to close off one of the three leaking points Tuesday, but added, \"I don't believe that will change the total amount of oil that will be leaked.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nStephen Herbert, chef and owner of Abita Springs Cafe on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, said the potential impact was \"tremendous.\" But Herbert, who holds a degree in fish biology and lived in the marshes for 10 years before entering the restaurant business, expressed surprise that the story has become a national one.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I'm really astounded that the rest of the people in the United States really give a flip about this,\" he said. Louisiana's coastal marshlands have been shrinking at the rate of two football fields a day for a quarter-century, he said, \"and nobody gave a flip about that.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHerbert's 16-table restaurant, located 25 miles from New Orleans, specializes in Cajun food, and at least half of his orders are for meals that contain fish. In anticipation of rising prices, he ordered an extra gallon of shucked oysters and another case of shrimp, but that was all his refrigerators could store, the 56-year-old restaurateur said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe estimated 210,000-gallon-per-day flow of oil from the damaged well continued unabated Tuesday, 12 days after the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon sank off Louisiana. The break in the winds kept the slick from advancing much toward the coast, but Jindal said the weather is expected to turn unfavorably Thursday.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe first oil was not expected to reach the shores of the U.S. mainland for another three days, Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs owner of the well, BP is responsible for the cleanup and its costs. It blames Transocean, which it hired to drill the well, for the failure of a critical piece of equipment that was designed to shut off the well in case of emergency.\r\r\n\r\r\nAcross the Gulf Coast, emergency workers and volunteers helped string floating booms across inlets and beaches in an attempt to fend off any advancing oil. Chocolate-colored streaks of oily water could be seen off Dauphin Island, on the Alabama coast. And crew boats that normally supply oil wells were laying booms around Ship Island, off the shores of Mississippi and about 10 miles north of the spill's leading edge.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Capt. Louis Skrmetta, who runs excursions out to the Mississippi Sound barrier islands, said efforts to protect the islands and waterways were inadequate. He said Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour -- who called the spill \"a manageable problem\" Monday -- was doing less to combat the oncoming slick than his counterparts in Alabama and Louisiana.\r\r\n\r\r\nKNOE: Community rallies around rig families\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The governor's leaving it up to BP", "3340": "4 a.m.", "3341": "where they grinned and repeated their disbelief at what was happening", "3342": "The neighbors", "3343": "mortgage foreclosures.\r\n\r\nMany good tenants are suffering because building owners have fallen behind on their mortgage payments, he said Thursday on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"These poor people are seeing everything they own put out on the street. ...

Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the historian at the National First Ladies' Library, points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed, liked European style and had American designers copy it.

Publishers, like Goma Books, one of the first to print cell phone novels, have also launched their own keitai shosetsu sites, which they use to sift through for talent whose work will be marketable on bookshelves.\r\n\r\nGoma's mobile story site Orion carries 20,000 novels and has approximately two million monthly users, according to the company. Goma has also published several top-selling keitai shosetsu, including \"The Red Thread,\" by Mei (also a pen name).\r\n\r\nSince it was released in 2007, the story, which revolves around the romance of two middle school students, has sold nearly 2 million copies and was adapted for a TV series and movie last December.

Watch Zeynep Fadilioglu show off her work and inspirations \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe shores of the Bosporus Strait are studded with 16th century masterpieces such as the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by the Ottoman Empire's most famous architect, Mimar Sinan, and ornate, neo-Baroque jewels designed by the Armenian Balyan family in the 19th century. But Istanbul's most senior Muslim cleric laments that mosque design suffered a decline after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I.\r\n\r\n\"In the last 70, 80 years, we have built mosques that are copies of Ottoman architecture,\" said Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul. \"This wasn't a good development, because the copy can never be as good as the original.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu and her team of artists are hoping to change that.  Look at photos of the mosque \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe Sakirin Mosque was commissioned by a wealthy Turkish Arab family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe designers put a number of contemporary touches on the structure, giving it plate glass walls etched with gold-leaf verses from the Quran, framed by giant cast-iron grids.\r\n\r\nThe mihrab -- the alcove that points worshippers in the direction of Mecca -- is made of asymmetrical ovals, similar to a design used by Fadillioglu to decorate a restaurant in London. And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops.\r\n\r\n\"The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,\" Fadillioglu explained. \"So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the artists here never worked on a mosque before.\r\n\r\n\"It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,\" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. \"If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area. Sort of as if (they are) unwanted in the mosque,\" she said. \"That is not what Islam is about. ...

Vegetables in particular will cost you little in the way of calories while offering huge health benefits.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour weekly goal is to eat five to nine servings of fruits and veggies a day. That's not as challenging as it may seem. The serving sizes are reasonable one medium-size fruit, a half cup of cooked vegetables, three-quarters of a cup of 100-percent juice, one cup of raw leafy vegetables, a quarter cup of dried fruit.\r\r\n\r\r\nMix fruit into your breakfast cereal, add lettuce and tomato to your sandwich (with a side of a vegetable-based soup), eat a piece of fruit in the afternoon and a vegetable side at dinner, and you've taken care of at least five servings.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore shopping, write down the names of five richly colored vegetables and fruits that you really like, then add to the list two that you're curious about and are willing to try.\r\r\n\r\r\nWeek Two: Defy your white flour urge\r\r\n\r\r\nUntil recently, it seemed that only nutritionists (and cereal box labels) used the words whole grain. Now delicious whole grain soups, desserts, and breads --bursting with color, texture and flavor -- have become popular. It's also widely known that they have the power to deliver key antioxidants.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour weekly goal is to make sure that half of your grain servings per day (three to five one-ounce servings) are whole grains such as wild rice, brown rice, barley, bulgur, corn (polenta), faro, quinoa, wheat berries, or whole wheat couscous.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhole grain foods are not refined, which means they contain all three parts of the grain, including the two lost in the refining process -- the outer layer, bran, which provides fiber, B vitamins, and antioxidants; and the germ, the nutrient-packed inner portion, containing protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The endosperm, the starchy part of the grain left in refined products such as white flour, contains some protein and lots of carbs but few nutrients. Look for the word whole on the ingredient list, followed by the name of the grain.\r\r\n\r\r\nResearch shows that adding even a moderate amount of whole grain to your diet every day -- whole grain cereal topped with fruit for breakfast, toasty multigrain bread at lunch, and a pilaf or grain salad for dinner -- significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and digestive system and hormone-related cancers.\r\r\n\r\r\nWeek Three: Get the perks of dairy -- without all the fat\r\r\n\r\r\nThis week, add some reduced-fat dairy", "3752": "The president's approval rating stood at 64 percent", "3753": "Democrat or Republican,\"  said Ossoff, who is also the director of research for the New Hampshire Institute of Politics.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Obama rode into the White House", "3754": "Ladies", "3755": "Monday when it was revealed that their son had committed suicide after battling depression.\r\n\r\nPoets", "3756": "The puzzles", "3757": "27 million square kilometers", "3758": "1 spot on Forbes' 2009 Celebrity 100 list.\r\n\r\nJolie's fame, evidenced by magazine covers and TV, radio, newspaper and Web stories, outweighed Winfrey's, giving her the edge as \"the most powerful celebrity in the world\" based on Forbes' formula, Forbes Senior Editor Matthew Miller said.\r\n\r\nWinfrey, who was at the top for two years straight, grossed $275 million last year, compared with Jolie's $27 million, Miller said.\r\n\r\n\"We try and measure a celebrity's power, and we look at two metrics to do that,\" Miller said. \"We look at money, and we look at fame.\"\r\n\r\nA world tour, which helped Madonna pull in $110 million, and a bumper crop of tabloid gossip pushed the Material Girl into the third spot, up from her 21st ranking on last year's list.\r\n\r\nBeyonce Knowles held steady in fourth, same as last year, with $87 million in income from her multiplatform empire, Miller said.

A series of exercises, lectures, and meditations stretched over 10 months, Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people's lives.\r\n\r\nLike some participants, Joan, who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at Spirit Rock, initially balked at the idea of singing. \"I thought James wanted me to join a choir,\" she says, \"but I took it on faith that the singing was going to work.\" So she started trilling along with the \"Hairspray\" soundtrack while driving. \"It seemed ridiculous, but that's what initially helped me the most.\"\r\n\r\n\"The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being,\" says Baraz. \"In other words, it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good.\" The first and most important step, he says, is intention: making the decision to be happy.\r\n\r\nRobert Holden, Ph.D., author of \"Happiness Now! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast\" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. \"Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow. For centuries, optimists and pessimists have argued over who's right, and the answer is they both are; each sees what they're looking for. If you focus on happiness, that's what you become more aware of.\"\r\n\r\nOnce participants have made up their minds to be happier, Baraz gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in Berkeley and in twice-monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind.

This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped?

At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care.\r\n\r\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise. It was the promise that his $787 billion stimulus package would create 3.5 million new jobs.\r\n\r\nIf \"SNL\" had asked the question, the answer would be: Not Done! The job hasn't even been started. The United States is losing more jobs by the minute. Before we turn this economy around, job loss could reach 9 million in the past two years and unemployment could reach 10.5 percent.\r\n\r\nThis didn't happen all on his watch and a big chunk of the stimulus is not yet spent. But if we don't get Americans back to work, the other promises President Obama made will pale in importance. Focus on jobs, Mr. President.\r\n\r\nThe highest unemployment rate in 25 years is about real Americans all across this country who are hurting and depressed. That's a topic that's even \"Saturday Night Live\" can't joke about, because it's tragic. All Americans want to see this president succeed in getting that job done. iReport.com: 'SNL' won't hurt Obama\r\n\r\nThe president has made a lot of promises regarding health care reform", "4177": "Heather Ellis", "4178": "will take effect in 30 days", "4179": "requires him to report daily to the police station nearest his home in Cala Rajada", "4180": "University College London", "4181": "Friday saying it had received several complaints from customers who encountered a foul smell and taste in boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe bakery says it tested the cookies and determined that they are safe for consumers to eat.

He was subdued by passengers and crew.\r\r\n\r\r\nNo air marshals were on the flight, generating additional criticism of the service.\r\r\n\r\r\nDespite efforts by Obama and assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that FAMS will become more effective, one air marshal told CNN, \"Nothing's particularly changed for me since Christmas Day, or (for) a big percentage of people that I work with.

The senior Bush, George H.W., was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey, and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy, inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions.\r\n\r\nBut the real question being debated on cable TV because of the \"SNL\" parody is this: \"Has the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?\"\r\n\r\nI can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end.

He was hospitalized upon his return to New York, then sent home.\r\n\r\nAs a correspondent for Vanity Fair magazine, Dunne was a fixture at some of the most famous trials of our times -- Claus von Bulow, William Kennedy Smith, the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Michael Skakel and Phil Spector.\r\n\r\nHe discovered his magazine writing career in his 50s, through personal tragedy -- his daughter's murder.\r\n\r\nHe vented his anger at the legal system in \"Justice: A Father's Account of the Trial of his Daughter's Killer,\" following the murder trial of John Sweeney, the estranged boyfriend who strangled 22-year-old Dominique Dunne, in 1982. Sweeney spent fewer than three years in prison.\r\n\r\nDunne's article was published by Vanity Fair and he accepted then-editor Tina Brown's offer to write full-time for the magazine. Calling himself a \"diarist,\" Dunne dropped bold-faced names as he spilled behind-the-scenes nuggets gleaned from courtrooms and dinner parties alike.\r\n\r\n\"It is fair to say that the halls of Vanity Fair will be lonelier without him and that, indeed, we will not see his like anytime soon, if ever again,\" said editor Graydon Carter in a tribute posted on the magazine's Web site.\r\n\r\nHe bristled at one writer's oft-repeated description of him as \"Judith Krantz in pants.\" He preferred to be known as a crime victim's advocate and frequently spoke at events sponsored by victims' groups.\r\n\r\nThe fact he personally knew many of the people he wrote about set Dunne apart from other crime writers.\r\n\r\nDunne wrote that he met music producer Phil Spector for dinner three times during the Simpson murder trial. \"He knew every detail of the trial and story,\" Dunne wrote. \"He carried a gun when we saw each other, but he never pulled it on me.\" Spector later became a defendant in a trial Dunne covered.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to CNN in June, while promoting the DVD release of a documentary of his life called \"After the Party.\" At the time, he said he was feeling well, happy, and hopeful the treatments were working. \"I'm pro stem cell,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut even then, he seemed to know he was in a race against time. \"I want to have one more best seller, before I cool,\" Dunne said. \"It's wonderful to have a best seller.\"\r\n\r\nHe said his personal story puts the lie to the claim by another high society writer, the late F. Scott Fitzgerald, that there are no second acts in life.\r\n\r\n\"This is the third act,\" Dunne said. \"I have a novel coming out. I finally got it finished in the clinic ... I'm calling it 'Too Much Money.' That's a hooking title.\"\r\n\r\nDunne looked back on his life during the hour-long lunchtime phone chat.\r\n\r\nHe said he had just one regret -- his failed marriage to his wife, Lenny, who died in 1997. The couple never formally divorced.\r\n\r\n\"I loved that marriage,\" he said. \"Lenny was the love of my life. And yet I ruined it. I wasn't formed yet. The regret is that I hurt her.\"\r\n\r\nMarc Juris, truTV's executive vice president, recalled Dunne as \"a master storyteller ... who always kept his eye on the human story behind the crimes.\"\r\n\r\nBesides hosting his own show on truTV, Dunne appeared frequently on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dominick Dunne was one of the finest people I've known,\" King said. \"He was a terrific writer, a raconteur, and a familiar face on 'Larry King Live' for many years. He was a wonderful human being.\"\r\n\r\nIn court, Dunne always dressed impeccably, wearing dark jackets and gray flannels, sharply starched shirts complete with cufflinks and club-style ties. He used a fountain pen to jot notes in small bound notebooks.\r\n\r\nHe was unabashedly pro-prosecution, although he said he \"lost no sleep\" over Robert Blake's acquittal on a charge of killing his wife, and was troubled by Martha Stewart's conviction on lying to investigators about a stock deal.\r\n\r\nWhen Simpson's acquittal was announced in 1995, Dunne's jaw dropped and the courtroom cameras caught his expression. It became an iconic image. Simpson later was found liable in a wrongful death suit and ordered to pay more than $33 million to the victims' families.\r\n\r\nDunne had been battling cancer for several years -- a fight that became widely known when he collapsed in court last year while covering Simpson's Las Vegas armed robbery trial. He wasn't in court to see Simpson sentenced to prison.\r\n\r\nDunne's life story reads like one of his novels. He was born to a well-to-do family in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1925; his father was a cardiac specialist. Dunne attended preppy Williams College, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, winning the Bronze star.\r\n\r\nHe later found work in New York as a stage manager for \"The Howdy Doody Show,\" a popular kids' show when television was in its infancy.\r\n\r\nHe moved to Hollywood, rubbing elbows with the biggest names in show business during the 1960s, and became a movie producer. But he soon became addicted to alcohol and drugs, hit bottom and became his own worst nightmare -- a nobody.\r\n\r\nHe sobered up and retired to a one-room cabin in Oregon to write his first novel, then headed back to New York with just a suitcase and his typewriter.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Dunne wrote his first", "4430": "Portuguese", "4431": "more than 100", "4432": "the conflict", "4433": "$22 billion", "4434": "the potential benefits and drawbacks of each type of loan", "4435": "Bear Grylls", "4436": "240", "4437": "the most serious charges against him", "4438": "1", "4439": "North Africa ahead of a midnight Sunday deadline.\r\n\r\nReinhard and Christine Lenz, right, the parents of kidnapped Austrian Andrea Kloiber.\r\n\r\n\"There are efforts in all areas, unrelenting efforts to secure the earliest possible release of our citizens,\" Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal told CNN.\r\n\r\nThe team of high-ranking government officials met Sunday morning and planned to work throughout the day, he said.\r\n\r\nWolfgang Ebner, 51, and Andrea Kloiber, 44, were last heard from on February 18 while on a vacation in southern Tunisia, foreign ministry spokesman Martin Gaertner said.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, the Austrian government received an audio message via the Internet from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claiming to have kidnapped the pair.\r\n\r\nThe kidnappers' primary demand is the release of five prisoners in Algeria and Tunisia", "4440": "very deeply", "4441": "western Sudan", "4442": "1,500", "4443": "Robin van Persie", "4444": "four years ago", "4445": "mental health providers", "4446": "clip", "4447": "first", "4448": "terrorism, war crimes ... and wrongful death.\"\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs are asking for $10 million in compensatory damages", "4449": "Larry King", "4450": "more than 8,000", "4451": "British", "4452": "cholera", "4453": "military and law enforcement veterans", "4454": "biotech company", "4455": "Operation Falcon, a nationwide sweep to arrest some of the most violent offenders.

None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control.\r\n\r\nRunning with such rumors has far-reaching implications.

Everyone from Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black and radio personality Rachel Maddow to Joe Solmonese, the president of Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay advocacy group, seem to be blasting Obama for everything from \"don't ask don't tell\" to Adam Lambert not winning American Idol.\r\n\r\nIn their minds, Obama is not moving fast enough on behalf of the GLBT community. The outcry is not completely without merit -- the Justice Department's unnerving brief on the Defense of Marriage Act immediately comes to mind. I was upset by some of the statements, but not surprised. (After the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, President Ronald Reagan's initial handling of AIDS and, more recently, Katrina, there is little that surprises me when it comes to the government and the treatment of its people.)\r\n\r\nStill, rarely has criticism regarding Obama and the GLBT community come from the kind of person you would find standing in line at a spot like The Prop House, and there's a reason for that.\r\n\r\nDespite the catchiness of the slogan, gay is not the new black.\r\n\r\nBlack is still black.\r\n\r\nAnd if any group should know this, it's the gay community.\r\n\r\nBars such as The Prop House, or Bulldogs in Atlanta, Georgia, exist because a large number of gay blacks -- particularly those who date other blacks, and live in the black community -- do not feel a part of the larger gay movement. There are Gay Pride celebrations, and then there are Black Gay Prides.\r\n\r\nThere's a popular bar in the heart of the nation's capital that might as well rename itself Antebellum, because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor.

Unable to cope financially, they decided to give her up temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\r\n\r\nThat's when Jerry and Louise Baker stepped in and agreed to take temporary custody of Anna, when she was 4 weeks old. The Bakers said they made a verbal agreement with the Hes to take care of Anna until she was 18.\r\n\r\nBut the Hes dispute that. They wanted their daughter back soon after her first birthday and eventually went to court to have their parental rights restored. After a bitter legal battle, the Hes finally prevailed and Anna was returned to her parents. Anna was given a six-month transition period to adjust to her biological family before the Hes left the United States.\r\n\r\nNow back in China, Anna is still finding it hard to adjust.

She said she would talk about why she left \"one day when the kids are bigger.\"\r\n\r\nJack He says the couple disagreed over how they should raise their children.

Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites, for instance.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave. Another man's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot, one of his legs was found near a grave, a hip was found inside the grave, his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave.\r\n\r\n\"What we do here is we sort them out,\" said Katzmarzyk, the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker, simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together.  Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP's work \u00bb\r\n\r\nThen, a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives.\r\n\r\nBut DNA can only go so far, and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk's table are those of a man and his 22-year-old son, it cannot say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21-year-old or his 24-year-old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point.\r\n\r\nIt's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related. Across the room, brothers lie next to each other, but as yet the scientists do not know who is who.\r\n\r\nSo Katzmarzyk and her colleagues are also experts in forensic anthropology, using other pointers to make an identification.\r\n\r\nThey will look for clues to the age of the remains and any other factors that could identify them: Did the man break his leg as a child? What clothes was he wearing? How tall was he?\r\n\r\n\"We started to look at clothing, place of disappearance,\" said Katzmarzyk.\r\n\r\n\"We use all kinds of evidence to identify as many people as possible.\"  Watch a Bosnia concentration camp survivor describe the torture and rape she witnessed \u00bb\r\n\r\nAbout 5,200 people out of the 8,000 executed at Srebrenica have been identified with the help of ICMP, but new mass graves continue to be found and more remains are delivered to the facility in Lukavac to be matched.\r\n\r\nYears of work lie ahead -- if governments continue to contribute to the project.\r\n\r\n\"We still have many more IDs to make, but what we need are additional funds to ensure that the process is completed.

Negotiations were under way for the surrender of the sixth person named in the indictment, O'Neill said.\n\nAll six suspects were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a law used to target organized crime groups -- in this case, the Gambino crime family.\n\nGotti appeared Tuesday afternoon before a judge, who ordered him held without bail. His attorney, Charles Carnesi, told reporters the charges against his client were baseless.\n\n\"I can guarantee you that this case will be based on people who have been convicted of various crimes who do not want to go to jail,\" Carnesi said outside the courthouse.\n\n\"Let's face it, they have the money, they have the resources, they have an army of agents and most of all they have the ability to go to people who are willing to lie and say, 'OK, here's the key.

Watch Gotti being led away in handcuffs\n\nCarnesi said he was surprised by the judge's decision to hold Gotti without bail. He said it would be his preference to keep Gotti in New York as long as possible \"so that we can maintain contact with him\" and suggested he enter his not-guilty plea by video to the Florida court.\n\nGotti, 44, of Oyster Bay, New York, has served as an associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss in the organization, the indictment alleges, as well as a member of a captains' committee formed in the early 1990s to assist in the administration of the family.\n\nHis co-defendants are John Burke, 47, a New York prison inmate; James Cadicamo, 33, of Tampa, Florida; David D'Arpino, 33, of Howard Beach, New York; Michael Finnerty, 43, of Oceanside, New York; and Guy Peden, 47, of Wantagh, New York.\n\nBurke and Peden are also accused of participating in the murder of Gotterup, according to authorities, and Burke and D'Arpino are charged in the death of John Gebert, who was killed in 1996 in Queens. In addition, Cadicamo is charged with conspiring to beat or kill a man named Michael Malone to prevent Malone's testimony in a case, and with retaliating against Malone for his cooperation with authorities.\n\nA number of cases culminated in the indictment, which names people in Florida and New York, the prosecutor said. \"I think what you have here is, you have the Gambino crime family reaching out to Tampa", "4618": "Russell Travers of the National Counterterrorism Center.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report says al Qaeda and its extremist supporters have moved across the Afghan border \"to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier, where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide, train terrorists, communicate with the followers, plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Pakistan alone, the report says, attacks more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, with a sharp increase in their \"coordination, sophistication and frequency.\" Last year there were 1,839 terrorist \"incidents,\" compared with 890 in 2007, Travers said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border, including Balochistan, the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt also notes the government's inability to get a handle on the extremists. Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces, it says, \"the government of Pakistan's authority in the area continued to be challenged.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nRonald Schlicher, the State Department's acting coordinator of counterterrorism, told reporters the Obama administration has \"real concerns\" that al Qaeda's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We have a real sense that it's happening, but we have imperfect knowledge of what they're doing,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nPakistan's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari.

People started looking at her in a different light, and she was judged as a less serious candidate.\r\n\r\nSaturday's skit portraying President Obama as a man who made a lot of promises and hasn't been able to fulfill many -- if any -- has been analyzed over and over with a constant rerun of the \"SNL\" clip.\r\n\r\nIn the comedy skit, the president is asked about unrealized campaign promises, including closing Gitmo, combating global warming, allowing openly gay people to serve in the military, withdrawing from Iraq, improving the status of the fight in Afghanistan, reforming health care and several others. On screen the response on a check list was: that each item was \"not done.\"  Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous. Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president.  See how 'SNL' has portrayed presidents \u00bb  President Gerald Ford, a gifted athlete, could never overcome the image of a bumbling, clumsy man who banged his head constantly after the hilarious portrayal of him by Chevy Chase. The senior Bush, George H.W., was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey, and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy, inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions.\r\n\r\nBut the real question being debated on cable TV because of the \"SNL\" parody is this: \"Has the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?\"\r\n\r\nI can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats will add pensively to the words: \"Not Done\" from the \"SNL\" skit, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans would add assertively : \"Not ever!\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \"Camelot II\"; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care.\r\n\r\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise.

The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich has been the subject of scrutiny over her real estate deals, most notably those involving businessman Antoin Rezko", "4808": "Shiite", "4809": "your services, your family", "4810": "can sympathize", "4811": "14", "4812": "an emotional Kiley Barnes", "4813": "100 yards", "4814": "the Walter Kerr Theater in New York's theater district", "4815": "physical world", "4816": "Nebraska", "4817": "The 500-year-old painting depicts the head and shoulders of Christ and is in sparkling", "4818": "sick with worry", "4819": "Eight", "4820": "the Jackson 5 -- arrayed behind them.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson brothers, here in the 1970s, were driven to be great by their father, Joseph.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be the all-American clan, gold records arranged behind them, the boys loose and smiling, the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor.\r\n\r\nOver the years, that fa\u00e7ade crumbled. The brothers bickered; some made accusations of abuse. But the group remained tight-knit through crises, including Thursday's tragedy, when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center.\r\n\r\nThe journey began with music in Gary, Indiana. Joseph Jackson, the patriarch, played in a short-lived band called the Falcons (no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett) in the 1950s. His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel.\r\n\r\nKatherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966.\r\n\r\nBy that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: \"He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, \"Please don't be mad at me.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson disputed the word \"beat,\" but didn't question Michael's account.\r\n\r\n\"I whipped him with a switch and a belt,\" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, \"I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick.\"\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions.\r\n\r\n\"We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,\" he said. \"I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \"chitlin circuit\" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \"the last big stars to come off my assembly line,\" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site.\r\n\r\nThe group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a collaboration,\" Gamble said. \"They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians.\"\r\n\r\nHuff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a \"fantastic meal\" cooked by Katherine Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing but respect for the father,\" added Gamble. \"He's a great man. He made something out of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nEven during that era, however, Michael was standing out. Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded. Going solo with Quincy Jones producing, as he did in 1979, was the right move, Gamble and Huff said.\r\n\r\nThe family dynamics kept changing", "4821": "felony conspiracy counts", "4822": "in a hail of bullets", "4823": "FMLN", "4824": "February 13, 2009", "4825": "International law", "4826": "Susan Boyle", "4827": "abuse toward Christians", "4828": "the officer hospitalized", "4829": "Thirty-three percent of the Medicaid population smokes, compared with 20% of the U.S. population", "4830": "England", "4831": "silver", "4832": "Turkish Arab family", "4833": "Michael Jackson", "4834": "reduce water waste by 10 million gallons", "4835": "northern Baghdad", "4836": "bones", "4837": "The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend", "4838": "NEW YORK", "4839": "basketball", "4840": "conservative", "4841": "Grylls", "4842": "retires", "4843": "the doctors were very pleased with the result.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe E!

And the way she's done it? It's largely through the fashion choices she's made.\r\n\r\nEach of her predecessors has brought a unique perspective and personality to the east wing of the White House, helping to shape how the nation views the president and how the world views the nation.\r\n\r\nThe use of fashion and image as a political strategy is an underrated factor. While Washington's political cognoscenti debate the successes and failures of the young Obama presidency, one half of Washington's newest power couple fine tunes fashion as a political strategy -- and it's working for her.  See photos of Michelle Obama's fashion \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe fashion authorities who are gathered this week in New York for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, more than seven months into the Obama presidency, are watching Michelle Obama's redefinition of the role of first lady with professional and personal interest.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary standard for the job was set decades ago by Jacqueline Kennedy, who had both a high sense of fashion and the style to pull it off. Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the historian at the National First Ladies' Library, points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed, liked European style and had American designers copy it. She even went as far as to personally design her own outfits on three important state occasions, including her famous White House dinner for Nobel laureates, while letting other designers take the credit.\r\n\r\nThe comparisons between Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Obama are as apt as the comparisons between their husbands.

It was a way to document what was happening in our lives. At that time, there was a lot of local news stories. There were a lot of people in the country and the world, believe it or not, pulling for us. As you know, sextuplets are not born every day, so there was a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nWe did the one-hour special to show everyone.

These are not the shouts of sibling rivalry or parental annoyance. This is the high-pitched, ear-shattering sound of a 13-year-old girl. More accurately, it is the sound of a frustrated, irritated, very loud teenager with autism.\r\n\r\nMarissa, the middle Bilson child, was diagnosed with autism when she was a toddler. Her mother, Mary, a nurse, knew something wasn't right early on, when young Marissa's tantrums were off the charts and seemingly unwarranted.\r\n\r\nBut during the first few years, doctors told Mary Bilson that her daughter was fine and this behavior would eventually pass. They were wrong on both counts.\r\n\r\nMarissa's behavior has not passed; it has, in fact, become worse. According to Bilson, Marissa and her tantrums rule the household. \"I don't want to hear her screaming and tantruming, so we pretty much let her do what she wants,\" Bilson says. \"We\" means Mary, her husband, John, and their two other children, Brittany, 15, and 6-year-old Brendan.\r\n\r\nKeeping the peace means that, when it comes to Marissa, the rules are different. She is allowed unlimited time on the one family computer. She is allowed access to her siblings' rooms and possessions. She is allowed to eat dinner at the computer instead of the family table.  Watch part one of the Bilsons' journey \u00bb\r\n\r\nBut before you sit in judgment of the Bilsons, and suggest they just need a firm hand to keep their middle child in line, consider one thing: They are trying to cope with a child with severely impaired social sensibilities.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think people who don't have children with autism know how tough it is to deal with them?\" CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, asked Marissa's mom in a recent interview.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Mary Bilson replied. \"And I don't see how they could.\"\r\n\r\nShe's right -- we can't, because many of us have never seen autism in action, day in and day out.  Learn more about autism \u00bb\r\n\r\nAutism is described on the National Institutes of Health Web site as a \"developmental disorder that appears in the first three years of life, and affects the brain's normal development of social and communication skills.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, autism and related disorders affect about one out of every 150 babies born each year.\r\n\r\nAutism manifests itself in many different ways. Although there are some common threads, like language issues, repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others, specific behavioral patterns are largely unique to the individual. \"Children with autism are all different; they are like snowflakes,\" explains Dr. Ronald Leaf, co-director of the group Autism Partnership.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that Leaf believes they all have in common is that \"they are not expected to do enough.\" Leaf insists we have set the bar too low for what we think children and adults with autism can do. \"They are highly teachable,\" he says. \"You just have to have a good teacher.\"\r\n\r\nA good teacher is exactly what Bilson was looking for to help her with Marissa. The family had already tried various programs, starting when Marissa was a toddler -- but nothing completely worked for her. And as Marissa entered her teen years, her behavior grew worse. Mary knew that her daughter needed to be reined in, and it needed to be done now.\r\n\r\n\"She is getting older. She's 13 and her tantrums are louder and longer than they used to be. It's just so inappropriate. It was OK when she was much younger, but now that she's going to be an adult soon, she can't be behaving this way,\" Bilson says with tired resignation.\r\n\r\nBut what could the Bilsons do? This family doesn't have a lot of extra money, and most programs either aren't covered by insurance or have long waiting lists. The costs are staggering, according to the Web site FightingAutism.org.

I am proud to be there to represent them today.\n\nAfter almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.\n\nAfter 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.\n\nBlackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.\n\nAt the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.\n\nThe areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.\n\nAny incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.\n\nIn doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.\n\nBlackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.\n\nThe company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented.\n\nThe worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards.\n\nIn Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force. Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions.\n\nMy understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation, but those results are not yet available.

Last year, antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined. In the United States, the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year.\r\n\r\nCompanies lost an average of $4.6 million in intellectual property last year, according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by Purdue University and McAfee.\r\n\r\n\"As the economy has declined, we've seen the threat landscape increase,\" David DeWalt, president and CEO of McAfee, recently told Richard Quest for CNN International's \"Quest Means Business.\"\r\n\r\nThat increase has helped antivirus makers such as McAfee snare record returns -- the company's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year.\r\n\r\nBut companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with Web-savvy criminals, experts say.\r\n\r\n\"The fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains,\" said Michael Fraser, director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.\r\n\r\n\"They have R&D departments, strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal,\" Fraser said.\r\n\r\nOn these Web sites, would-be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own \"botnet\" -- referring to software that can, unbeknownst to victims, turn their computers into spamming foot-soldiers for criminal networks. One Web site advertises software that can capture information for a popular Internet secured-payment provider for $500 -- discounted to $400 for the first 100 buyers.\r\n\r\nSkimmed credit card numbers and other personal-identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on Web sites, Fraser said. \"When police shut these Web sites down, they just mushroom up some other place,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAlthough the techniques of cyber crime have evolved, online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages. In the digital age, that means tempting with free downloads, money schemes and pornography.\r\n\r\nThe range of tools used by cyber criminals reveals the quick evolution of the industry. Viruses -- the first generation of the computer culprits -- are used for the computer equivalent of vandalism, as the malicious programs replicate, spread and damage computers.\r\n\r\n\"When the company was set up, we were seeing two or three new viruses a week,\" said Mahendra Negi, chief financial officer of Tokyo-based antivirus maker Trend Micro. \"Now there's a new one every two-and-a-half seconds.\r\n\r\n\"With the arrival of spam in 2001 and 2002, the big difference was it was commercial malware,\" Negi said. \"Once money became involved, the level of sophistication raised a hundred-fold.\"\r\n\r\nNow the biggest threats include \"phishing\" schemes and \"botnet\" attacks.\r\n\r\nPhishing is where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or Web site and trick victims into revealing passwords, credit card information and other personal data.\r\n\r\nBotnet attackers commandeer personal computers as part of a large network of \"zombie\" computers that, on command, target companies for spam attacks to cripple IT capabilities. Botnets -- some of which are large enough to deploy tens of billions of spam e-mails a day -- are often used in extortion schemes.\r\n\r\n\"They ring up the IT manager of a company and say, 'Pay us a million or we'll take you down',\" said Fraser, who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks.\r\n\r\nCompanies often pay up and shut up, computer experts say, rather than report the crime and garner publicity that may hurt their corporate reputation.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike prankster virus-makers, these malware makers are determined to stay hidden.\r\n\r\n\"Once it became a business, then (cyber criminals) began to look at what companies like us were doing, and figure out weaknesses,\" he said. \"They are very customer friendly ... they sell updates, they will highlight what the product does and what antivirus software can't detect them.\r\n\r\nAdding to the difficulty is the legal situation that in many jurisdictions, it is not illegal to create or sell malware.\r\n\r\n\"It's like the arms industry ... it's not a crime to build and sell them,\" Negi said.\r\n\r\nAnd because of the transnational nature of the crime, it's extremely difficult to prosecute. A scan of 500 headlines on Internet-related arrests from newspapers around the world the past two years found about 90 percent were related to child-pornography cases.\r\n\r\n\"Child pornography is easier to prosecute because it is possible to find the evidence on the perpetrator's computer systems,\" said Spafford of Purdue University.\r\n\r\nCyber-criminal networks are as porous as the Internet itself.\r\n\r\n\"There are multiple jurisdictions", "5080": "abuse toward Christians in Iraq", "5081": "Renee Zellweger", "5082": "Adam Sandler", "5083": "complications of cosmetic surgery", "5084": "15", "5085": "food stamps", "5086": "3-year-old", "5087": "2008 Summer Olympics", "5088": "At least six", "5089": "Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus", "5090": "The arrests were part of a large police operation", "5091": "Robert Baden-Powell", "5092": "Luxembourg City", "5093": "Sadness Party", "5094": "the Sydney", "5095": "The screening system is called the Passive Millimeter Wave", "5096": "lifting the ban", "5097": "vehicular homicide", "5098": "pizza sub", "5099": "medical student suspected of killing a woman he may have met through a Craigslist online ad was arraigned Tuesday and will be held without bail.\r\n\r\nMedical student Philip Markoff, 22, appears in court Tuesday in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nPhilip Markoff, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, listened intently but did not speak during the hearing in Boston Municipal Court.

Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman \"put up a fight,\" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service.\r\n\r\nShe sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified.\r\n\r\nAuthorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.  Watch police say assailant has perused Craigslist ads \u00bb\r\n\r\nSurveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man.\r\n\r\nPolice traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and \"the case just begins to build from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,\" Conley said.\r\n\r\nThere may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. \"If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is \"bearing up,\" according to attorney Salsberg.\r\n\r\n\"It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty,\" said Salsberg.\r\n\r\nMcAllister, in her e-mail to ABC, wrote, \"Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it.
