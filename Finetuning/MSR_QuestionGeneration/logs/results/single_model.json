Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise,\" Obama said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. president repeated his administration's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged \"concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama's remarks, delivered from State Dining Room, were the strongest yet from the United States. \"There must be reform,\" he said, \"political, social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In the absence of these reforms,\" he said, \"grievances have built up over time.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free and more hopeful,\" he concluded.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn his remarks, Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding. And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as \"hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, \"and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption.\" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported. A CNN witness saw the building ablaze.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said the collective consequences of the government's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Within that review is military\" assistance, Gibbs said.\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The die is cast,\" said Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs said, \"we've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms\" but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We don't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together,\" Gelb said, cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government.\r\r\n\r\r\nOften considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East, Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal, a strategic passageway for trade across the region.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt's government \"to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters, and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces,\" Clinton said Friday, referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"At the same time, protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"As a partner, we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately,\" Clinton said. \"They need to view civil society as their partner, not a threat.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nServers of Egypt's main internet provider were down early Friday, including servers for the Egyptian government's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarly Friday, Gibbs said that he is \"very concerned about violence in Egypt,\" tweeting that the \"government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut at least one internet service provider, Noor, was still working.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to \"defer non-essential travel to Egypt.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes,\" the agency added in a written travel alert.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times,\" the statement said, urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone.\r\r\n\r\r\nDelta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday, and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Barack Obama has requested \"multiple briefings\" on Egypt, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the target of the protesters' anger, \"but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels, including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama's messages and concerns are relayed,\" Vietor said.\r\r\n\r\r\nFormer Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak \"without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think that, if anything, one might ask why hasn't President Mubarak called President Obama and said, 'Are you with me or against me?' I mean, that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration,\" Cohen said.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances,\" he said this week.\r\r\n\r\r\nVice President Joe Biden said on \"PBS NewsHour\" on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator.\r\r\n\r\r\nStill, Biden said, \"violence isn't appropriate, and people have a right to protest.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nObama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe noted Thursday that Mubarak has been \"very helpful on a range of tough issues,\" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Wednesday, Gibbs said the U.S. administration was \"monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so, obviously, in Tunisia.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali", "161": "a vehicle", "162": "the error \"an aberration", "163": "Rohingya", "164": "10", "165": "her acting chops", "166": "307", "167": "U.S. first lady Laura Bush", "168": "about 20", "169": "Michael Friel", "170": "three years ago", "171": "labor unions", "172": "$5 million", "173": "his guilty plea", "174": "\"No one could survive that crash", "175": "A US Air big DC-9 or -10", "176": "amputated", "177": "Roma and 2-1", "178": "Ben Gurion Airport", "179": "Ahmed", "180": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A man charged with stalking sports reporter Erin Andrews", "181": "JAMAICA PLAIN", "182": "Terry Shoemaker", "183": "February 13, 2009", "184": "pirates", "185": "committing \"actions amounting to war crimes", "186": "30-year rule", "187": "Greenpeace", "188": "Mirza", "189": "Sudanese", "190": "18", "191": "asphyxiated herself in 1963 by putting her head in a gas oven at her London home while her two children slept in the next room, hanged himself at his home in Alaska, his sister Frieda told The Times newspaper.\r\n\r\nHughes, 47, was unmarried with no children of his own", "192": "Friday from a top former Clinton administration official", "193": "80", "194": "posthumous column", "195": "a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste", "196": "Chile and Peru", "197": "achieving", "198": "north-northwest motion", "199": "China's devastating earthquake", "200": "shoes", "201": "chains and whips already.

The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend.\r\n\r\n\"We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,\" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. \"It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paranormal Activity\" bills itself as \"the first-ever major film release demanded by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors. But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \"With its this-is-really-happening vibe, 'Paranormal Activity' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich\u00e9s. The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the film has earned a strong 85 percent approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\r\n\r\nMoviegoers agree. Rajiim Gross, an iReporter who posted a review of the film, said he found \"Paranormal Activity\" to be much better than \"Blair Witch Project,\" another indie-horror film to which it is being compared. Check out Rajiim Gross' iReport\r\n\r\n\"It actually scared the hell out of me,\" Gross said. \"I saw it during the day and I would hate to be someone who went home after seeing it late at night.\"\r\n\r\nGross said he believed the studio was smart to leverage the Internet to spread the word.

The bombs did not go off, and no one was hurt.\r\n\r\nThe SLA is best known for its 1974 kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.\r\n\r\nA parole board hearing in 2004 reduced the sentence related to the attempted bombing charge, but \"an administrative error failed to take into account\" the second-degree murder charge for the shooting death, Kernan said.\r\n\r\nDavid Nickerson, one of Olson's attorneys, said he and co-counsel Shawn Chapman Holley intend to file a petition with Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday.\r\n\r\nOlson cannot be treated as \"yo-yo\" in regard to the law, he said.\r\n\r\nChapman Holley called her return to custody \"ridiculous.\" \"It's like they make up all new rules when it comes to her,\" Chapman Holley told The Associated Press. \"It's like we are in some kind of fascist state.\"\r\n\r\nThe administrative error was verified late Saturday morning, Kernan said, after a thorough review of Olson's case. He said \"concerns\" about her release date prompted the review.\r\n\r\nOlson was taken into custody at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday night, Kernan said.\r\n\r\nOlson had been granted interstate parole and was on her way to Minnesota, where she lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999, Nickerson had said.\r\n\r\nFrom the Los Angeles airport, authorities took Olson to her home in Palmdale, California, where she remained until she was arrested midday Saturday, when the review was completed, Kernan said.\r\n\r\nOriginally named Kathleen Soliah, Olson fled California after authorities began looking for her and then changed her name and lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999 in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nShe had married and was raising three daughters.\r\n\r\nMany residents rallied to Olson's cause and helped post bail for her.\r\n\r\nBut one group in California, the Los Angeles Police Protective League", "291": "Robin van Persie", "292": "better", "293": "Fernando Alonso's controversial win at the German Grand Prix on Sunday, accusing its critics of hypocrisy", "294": "I love actresses", "295": "brightly colored class beads", "296": "It's not that they can't have sex", "297": "10", "298": "Army officials", "299": "another set-back", "300": "The 32-floor building", "301": "Traffic had to be rerouted to an another road", "302": "media", "303": "The issue", "304": "justice", "305": "people fleeing wars", "306": "McKinney", "307": "Sir Alex Ferguson", "308": "Funes", "309": "dead bodies", "310": "MySpace", "311": "Sandeep Kapoor, 40, and Khristine Eroshevich", "312": "my guess would be that she votes pretty similarly to me.", "313": "whatever I wanted", "314": "Grand Beach, Michigan", "315": "us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle.\r\n\r\nCNN: You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago?\r\n\r\nAlexander: In the community in Hyde Park, he and Mrs. Obama were just people I'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about, and we were of a generation. ...\r\n\r\nHe was in the law school, and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work didn't really cross so much. ... [We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community.\r\n\r\nCNN: And you did it by writing?\r\n\r\nAlexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years.\r\n\r\nCNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you?\r\n\r\nAlexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, \"Isn't that something?\" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's ahead of us?\r\n\r\nAlexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ...\r\n\r\nThe larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better.\r\n\r\nCNN: Can poetry help in that regard?\r\n\r\nAlexander: I do believe that it can.

Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence.\n\nThe state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors.

June 1 ballot.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile former Asian Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam is taking legal action against that punishment, his former fellow Executive Committee members have agreed to establish three new task forces and a \"good governance committee\" in order to clean up the sport's administration.\r\r\n\r\r\nBlatter revealed at a press conference in Zurich on Friday that he hopes they will be implemented by 2013.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We've been ambitious in our roadmap,\" the 75-year-old said. \"By 2013 we should have lived up to the requests made by the national associations in 2011.

They wanted to see something being done.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The transparency and compliance task force will be made up of presidents of national associations, and they will identify the problems with which the national associations are faced with respect to FIFA.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBlatter said the ExCo members, several of whom have faced accusations of corruption in the past decade, were unanimous in agreeing on the proposed roadmap.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There is only one question mark -- will we be able to live up to the details of it? I feel very happy that the Executive Committee is completely in step with what we want to achieve with the national associations,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We are moving forward with a FIFA that, especially due to the Good Governance Committee, will allow us in 2013 or even before to present an image other than the one we have currently.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBlatter, who said there would be a push to include at least one woman on the all-male ExCo for the first time, revealed that court documents from the 10-year-old case involving FIFA's former marketing partner ISL would be released.\r\r\n\r\r\nFIFA officials Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and former president Joao Havelange were accused of receiving payments from ISL, which folded in 2001.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe ExCo will examine the case in December and make the files available", "1722": "Tuesday", "1723": "help pave the way toward more open trade", "1724": "northwestern Mexico", "1725": "Sadr City", "1726": "Iraqi", "1727": "less than Palestinian sources reported", "1728": "first map of the entire lunar surface at high resolution, revealing the minerals of which it is made.\r\n\r\nExamining data from Chandrayaan-1, Pieters' team found signs of water at the moon's frigid poles.

Authorities say Zinkhan owns a home in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe FBI is working with its agents overseas and police in the Netherlands, Jones said.\r\r\n\r\r\nA nationwide alert for Zinkhan has been issued by Athens-Clarke County police.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe shootings took place at a community theater group's reunion Saturday in Athens, Georgia, just off campus.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice Capt. Clarence Holeman identified the victims as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe university terminated Zinkhan on Sunday, President Michael Adams told reporters on Monday.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas and owns a home in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was last seen driving a red, 2005 Jeep Liberty after the shootings Saturday.\r\r\n\r\r\nAuthorities do not believe Zinkhan is still on campus or in the city of Athens, University Police Chief Jimmy Williams said Monday. As a precaution, he added, security has been beefed up on campus, including officers on foot patrols carrying semiautomatic weapons.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe victims were all associated with the Town and Gown Players, a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The three people we lost (Saturday) were a part of the rich 50-year history of this theater and, more than that, were vital members of the Town and Gown family,\" the organization said Sunday on its Web site.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe site described Bruce as \"the binding force that held the Town and Gown community together.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Having worked with Town and Gown for over 20 years, at one time or another she served in every capacity at the theater, artistically and administratively, from leading lady to president of the board to chief cook and bottle washer.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHoleman said Saturday, \"It appeared (Zinkhan) and his wife (Bruce) were having problems.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMeanwhile, the university said that classes would be held Monday, as the school term enters its final week.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn a letter \"to the members of the University of Georgia community\" posted on the school's Web site, Adams said operations would continue uninterrupted. But, \"I urge everyone to continue to exercise caution until the suspect is apprehended,\" Adams said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams' letter said counseling would be available to any member of the faculty or staff and to students.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe university's annual end-of-year campus memorial service, in which those lost over the past year are remembered, is scheduled for Tuesday night, Adams said. Victims of Saturday's shooting will be honored at that service.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice said Zinkhan was not at the Town and Gown event originally but arrived and, according to Holeman of the Athens police, got into \"a disagreement\" with his wife. He left the scene, and police believe he went to his car, where the couple's children apparently were waiting, and returned with two handguns.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe shootings \"only took a few minutes,\" Holeman said. Police found eight shell casings.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter the shooting, Zinkhan left the scene with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived and left the children there.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe neighbor, Bob Covington, told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"He rang the doorbell, asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour,\" Covington said. \"I said sure, and he said there'd been some type of emergency, and he took off.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nZinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency, Covington said. He didn't question Zinkhan about the emergency, Covington said, adding that it wasn't unusual for someone in his family to watch the children.\r\r\n\r\r\nAn hour or so later, he said, police arrived and took the children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice searched Zinkhan's home on Saturday, but there was no indication of what evidence they might have gathered there.

Watch Hersman talk about previous warnings \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe NTSB recommended in 2006 that Metro transit replace or retrofit all of its Series 1000 trains, to bring them up to current safety standards.\r\n\r\nMetro transit responded that because it was constrained by tax-advantage leases, it intended to keep the 1000 Series until the end of 2014.\r\n\r\n\"Our recommendation was not addressed, so it [the case] has been closed in an unacceptable status,\" Hersman said.\r\n\r\nThe NTSB has no regulatory powers and can't force implementation.  Watch Hersman talk about the computer systems \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"The safety of our citizens is our highest priority and we must take every precaution that this loss of life does not occur again,\" said Hoyer, a Democratic congressman from Maryland.\r\n\r\nHe said he would soon introduce a final measure to authorize dedicated federal and local funding for Metro.\r\n\r\nThe Series 1000 cars comprise a quarter of Metro transit's 1,126 cars, or nearly 300", "2188": "BOGOTA", "2189": "The plastic surgeon", "2190": "Didier Deschamps", "2191": "Bachelet last week", "2192": "Nieves", "2193": "Inter Milan", "2194": "The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star", "2195": "Ohio", "2196": "Taylor Love", "2197": "participating in a combined cache sweep", "2198": "The federal government", "2199": "a bucket at Abby's feet", "2200": "Seven", "2201": "human rights", "2202": "The GAO report", "2203": "eyewitnesses", "2204": "hurricane damage", "2205": "switch to a new location that he hopes will help the English Premier League club remain competitive on an international scale", "2206": "Chevrolet Impala: Under the radar\r\n\r\nThe Chevy Impala is one of the best-selling cars in the U.S. This makes it the perfect choice for police departments who want a car that blends", "2207": "Gene Seymour", "2208": "no criminal history", "2209": "eight", "2210": "Keri Russell", "2211": "Brooklyn, New York", "2212": "Turkey", "2213": "Al Qaeda", "2214": "the Grateful Dead song", "2215": "Britain", "2216": "Obama's current rating", "2217": "the \"Michael and Michael\" site", "2218": "Human rights groups", "2219": "salvation", "2220": "one warehouse and ranch", "2221": "at least nine", "2222": "4 a.m.", "2223": "threats", "2224": "2.5 gallons", "2225": "high carbon content and porous nature", "2226": "remove BPA from infant bottles and feeding cups", "2227": "the state Department of Transportation", "2228": "arenas and record stores, big screens, parks and makeshift shrines", "2229": "Afghanistan", "2230": "the government's action", "2231": "Antarctica", "2232": "toe method", "2233": "Charles Manson", "2234": "The state defense minister", "2235": "even ending", "2236": "9", "2237": "Myanmar", "2238": "the defining symbol of the Holocaust", "2239": "The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation", "2240": "November 10", "2241": "12", "2242": "89", "2243": "5 pounds, 13 ounces", "2244": "the sale of political merchandise", "2245": "Salvatore Romano", "2246": "Jim Tuckwell", "2247": "heard", "2248": "collarbone", "2249": "surrendered", "2250": "Sunday", "2251": "13,200", "2252": "Scientific tests", "2253": "alleges criminal activity", "2254": "Birthday Cake\"  and \" Cockiness (Love It)\"", "2255": "the rest of his $100,000 estate", "2256": "seven", "2257": "first", "2258": "depression", "2259": "Indonesia", "2260": "Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday", "2261": "control", "2262": "Frank Buckles", "2263": "more locations", "2264": "Cell phone footage", "2265": "Customs officials said that tourists will be able to get the devices back when they leave the country", "2266": "life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays", "2267": "Paul Rieckhoff", "2268": "Ethan Sloop", "2269": "5,000", "2270": "three-year-old", "2271": "Michael Jackson", "2272": "14", "2273": "Saturday Night Live\" has spoofed, ridiculed and hammered presidents and other political figures without regard to political affiliation", "2274": "talk to reporters", "2275": "Miami", "2276": "about the next week", "2277": "Greenville, South Carolina", "2278": "improperly breaking down", "2279": "plastic", "2280": "upcoming race", "2281": "protest their crackdowns on their citizens", "2282": "I", "2283": "Casey Anthony's friend Amy Huizenga", "2284": "My breasts", "2285": "Ian Lerner", "2286": "Friday", "2287": "Wednesday", "2288": "Thursday", "2289": "the river", "2290": "ice cream shop", "2291": "100", "2292": "Florida", "2293": "global slump", "2294": "install on the orbiting telescope", "2295": "your services, your family", "2296": "Atwater", "2297": "a meal", "2298": "$9,369", "2299": "a full technical report", "2300": "2004", "2301": "Angela Lansbury", "2302": "Tsvangirai", "2303": "above 60 percent", "2304": "The residents", "2305": "amputated", "2306": "the company", "2307": "47", "2308": "seventh anniversary of the attacks", "2309": "Watch alleged Monday", "2310": "the art of Roman sculpture reached its zenith,\" Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets said.\r\n\r\nIt's tiny -- only about 6 centimeters high by 4 centimeters wide, Ben-Ami told CNN. \"That's why it is so impressive.

But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade", "3084": "control", "3085": "lions", "3086": "December 28", "3087": "above 60 percent", "3088": "Chester Arthur Stiles", "3089": "Philippines", "3090": "McCurry", "3091": "Spain", "3092": "CNN", "3093": "nine", "3094": "first", "3095": "his outspokenness", "3096": "the numbers", "3097": "Eyup Erdem", "3098": "Blackwater", "3099": "expel the Iranians", "3100": "Wednesday", "3101": "Lionel Messi", "3102": "decreases eye pressure", "3103": "tobacco-caused diseases", "3104": "Omar al-Bashir", "3105": "what you eat, writing it down and staying consistent", "3106": "could not attend her graduation from college or nursing school or her wedding last month", "3107": "two", "3108": "Apolo Anton Ohno", "3109": "gives a preference to both parties having skin", "3110": "Jamison Green is an educator, adviser and advocate on transgender issues, and the author of \"Becoming a Visible Man\" (Vanderbilt University Press, 2004).\r\n\r\nJamison Green transitioned from female to male just before his 40th birthday.\r\n\r\nWelcome, Chaz!\r\n\r\nBefore the word \"transsexual\" had been coined in English, an intrepid young person whose family belonged to the British nobility set out to transform herself from female to male.

Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for \"e-waste\" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nSome of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 a Greenpeace study, \"Not in My Backyard\", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\r\n\r\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\r\n\r\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\r\n\r\nIt's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading.\r\n\r\nThe volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste.\r\n\r\nEach one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years.\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market.\r\n\r\n\"Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,\" said Schoppink.\r\n\r\n\"It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem.\r\n\r\n\"The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it.

That includes New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who in a WOR radio appearance Friday said that city's labor unions -- many of whom swelled demonstrator ranks earlier this week -- depend on salaries that \"come from the taxes paid by the people they're trying to vilify.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe mayor did describe the city's unemployment rate as \"unacceptably high,\" and acknowledged that \"a lot of people are disaffected.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Some are legit, some aren't,\" Bloomberg said, describing the concerns of the demonstrators in Lower Manhattan.\r\r\n\r\r\nHis comments coincided with the city's announcement that 700 education workers will be laid off in an effort to close a budget gap. They also follow recently released census data that shows New York's poverty level has increased to 20.1%, the highest in more than a decade.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe remarks drew criticism from Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street, who claimed Bloomberg \"hasn't really represented all of New Yorkers.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The fact is there are thousands and thousands of us out on the streets, and he's not really recognizing that we're a movement,\" Combelic told CNN on Saturday. \"We should be heard by New York politicians.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Saturday, New York protesters set up a second base at Washington Square Park. The park in Greenwich Village is about two miles north of Zuccotti Park, a private park that's been considered the main rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in the city.\r\r\n\r\r\nA rally was held in Washington Square, followed by a now-customary people's assembly to discuss the movement and an art show Saturday evening.

Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nA senior State Department official said, \"our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,\" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is \"very concerned\" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,\" Gibbs said. \"We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States will review its \"assistance posture\" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party.\r\r\n\r\r\nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported.

Now delicious whole grain soups, desserts, and breads --bursting with color, texture and flavor -- have become popular. It's also widely known that they have the power to deliver key antioxidants.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour weekly goal is to make sure that half of your grain servings per day (three to five one-ounce servings) are whole grains such as wild rice, brown rice, barley, bulgur, corn (polenta), faro, quinoa, wheat berries, or whole wheat couscous.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhole grain foods are not refined, which means they contain all three parts of the grain, including the two lost in the refining process -- the outer layer, bran, which provides fiber, B vitamins, and antioxidants; and the germ, the nutrient-packed inner portion, containing protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The endosperm, the starchy part of the grain left in refined products such as white flour, contains some protein and lots of carbs but few nutrients. Look for the word whole on the ingredient list, followed by the name of the grain.\r\r\n\r\r\nResearch shows that adding even a moderate amount of whole grain to your diet every day -- whole grain cereal topped with fruit for breakfast, toasty multigrain bread at lunch, and a pilaf or grain salad for dinner -- significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and digestive system and hormone-related cancers.\r\r\n\r\r\nWeek Three: Get the perks of dairy -- without all the fat\r\r\n\r\r\nThis week, add some reduced-fat dairy, which will cream up your cooking and get healthy calcium into your diet (approximately 75 percent of adult Americans don't get the recommended daily allowance).\r\r\n\r\r\nStudies show not only that calcium helps prevent osteoporosis but that getting enough calcium each day (1,000 milligrams from ages 19 to 50 and 1,200 milligrams after age 50), along with adequate vitamin D (200 IU; 400 IU after age 50), helps control weight, lowers blood pressure, and may prevent certain types of cancer.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour goal is to eat three to four servings a day of low-fat cheeses, yogurt, and 1 percent or skim milk; the calcium in dairy products is the most readily absorbed by your body. If you're lactose intolerant, fortified soy products -- particularly those with calcium malate -- are a fine substitute in cooking and often contain similar amounts of protein, vitamin D, and calcium.\r\r\n\r\r\nI do not recommend fat-free dairy products, particularly cheese; instead of getting creamy, bubbly, and brown in recipes, it can turn rubbery and tasteless.\r\r\n\r\r\nWeek Four: Get protein\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the past three weeks, you have learned how vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat dairy can help you fill your plate with quality nutrients that don't pack a lot of calories. Now it's time to address protein. Getting enough is not something most of us need to worry about, but selecting well is.\r\r\n\r\r\nYour goal is to eat five to six ounces of lean and healthy protein a day. Eat it all in one meal (most restaurant servings of protein are at least five ounces), or eat smaller portions throughout the day.\r\r\n\r\r\nI often tell clients to divide their plate into quarters: Three quarters should be filled with whole grains and vegetables; one quarter should be a serving of protein -- such as shrimp, fish, chicken, beans, tofu, lean cuts of beef, or pork -- about the size of a deck of cards.\r\r\n\r\r\nPoultry and meat can take little time to cook", "3752": "64 percent", "3753": "Senate", "3754": "Ladies and gentlemen", "3755": "hanged", "3756": "The puzzles", "3757": "27 million square kilometers", "3758": "Matthew Miller", "3759": "About 50", "3760": "poor record keeping", "3761": "grown-up", "3762": "FBI", "3763": "Romania", "3764": "more young people to become politically active", "3765": "Nebraska", "3766": "Bullring Shopping Centre", "3767": "Arkansas university", "3768": "Germany", "3769": "padding numbers", "3770": "the river bottom", "3771": "Marek Edelman", "3772": "at least 321", "3773": "the NCAA", "3774": "the wind", "3775": "two", "3776": "afternoon", "3777": "The Yes", "3778": "Joy?\r\n\r\nBehar: This Miss California girl, I think she's doing great", "3779": "Iraqi Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani", "3780": "Thousands", "3781": "eminent domain", "3782": "activities you enjoy", "3783": "serious brain infection", "3784": "Seattle", "3785": "About 350", "3786": "the D-Day museum in Portsmouth, England", "3787": "mobile health care clinic", "3788": "rebels", "3789": "Maurice Jarre \u00bb\n\nJarre", "3790": "Northern Ireland", "3791": "surgeons", "3792": "The WMSC is expected to announce the reasons for its decisions on September 14.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn July the WMSC ruled that McLaren was in breach of Article 151c of the FIA International Sporting Code but recommended that no punitive measures were taken until a hearing of the FIA's International Court of Appeal on September 13. However, in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe murky story began in June of this year, when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena, Italy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren's chief designer Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan's wife, Trudy Coughlan, had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren's Woking headquarters. An employee of the copy shop, suspicious that confidential data was being copied, blew the whistle to Ferrari.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney, a friend and former colleague of Coughlan's (the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s). Stepney had been the team's chief mechanic, but in February took his new role as the team's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena, Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari issued the following press statement:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal, concerning the theft of technical information. Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut now the FIA is in possession of new evidence. Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso. On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa, Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated: \"The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession, or that such drivers have recently been in possession, of written evidence relevant to this investigation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe letter continued: \"I can confirm, given the importance of this issue, that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the International Sporting Code or the Formula One regulations. However, in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information, serious consequences could follow.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFive days later the WMSC announced it was to reconvene \"following the emergence of new evidence\", in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa in practice leading up to the Monaco Grand Prix. Stepney has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther drama overshadowed Alonso and Hamilton's one-two on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. Modena's public prosecutor, Giuseppe Tibis, issued a legal notice -- known as an 'avviso di garanzia' -- that six McLaren employees were under criminal investigation . The six included McLaren supremo Ron Dennis, managing directors Martin Whitmarsh and Jonathan Neale, technical director Jonathan Neale and designer Rob Taylor as well as Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis outcome has put a dark shadow McLaren's return to winning ways. The team, dominant in the late 1990s, had struggled with reliability for some years. But the team is not taking the decision lying down.

Watch how cyberspace is used by opposition \u00bb\r\n\r\nBut Kaveh Afrasiabi, a political scientist who supports Ahmadinejad, said the incumbent's widespread support in rural areas and small towns was the reason for his win with more than 62 percent of the vote.\r\n\r\nSince Moussavi contested the results, his supporters have taken to the streets every day, often clashing with police and Ahmadinejad's backers. iReport.com: On the ground in Iran\r\n\r\nSeven people were killed on Monday night in the capital, Tehran, after they allegedly attacked a military post near Azadi -- or Freedom -- Square, government-funded Press TV", "4128": "Passive Millimeter Wave", "4129": "Sinan", "4130": "Don Lemon: President Barack Obama issued a national call to service.

The incident on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, helped dash the youngest Kennedy brother's chances at the Oval Office in 1972 and 1980.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was more forgiving than the rest of the nation, however, backing Kennedy by a 3-to-2 margin in his 1970 bid to keep his Senate seat. That his brothers, John and Robert, had been assassinated in recent years may have been a factor, experts said.  Watch Kennedy attend brother Robert's funeral \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"Great expectations and great tragedy has always been the storyline of the Kennedys,\" said Christopher Arterton, dean of George Washington University's graduate school of political management. \"The people of Massachusetts were prepared to forgive a lot of transgressions.\"\r\n\r\nKennedy vanished to the family compound for days after the incident, huddling with advisers before emerging the following week to plead guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. A judge suspended his two-month jail sentence.\r\n\r\nCritics saw the plea as an attempt to stifle details that would have emerged during a trial.\r\n\r\nIn a display of the senator's legendary oratory, he delivered a nationally televised explanation and apology, saying it was \"indefensible\" that he hadn't called police until the day after the accident.  See how Chappaquiddick fit into Kennedy's legacy \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"If at any time, the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character or his ability, with or without justification, he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duty and should not continue in office,\" Kennedy said.\r\n\r\nJim Baughman, author of \"The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America since 1941,\" said he recalls Kennedy's address being \"less an explanation to the country than to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nThe nation's response was tepid. According to a Time-Harris poll in August 1969, about 44 percent of respondents said Kennedy failed \"to tell the real truth,\" 51 percent said his explanation was inadequate and 77 percent said he was wrong not to report the accident immediately.\r\n\r\nHowever, 58 percent of respondents said \"he has suffered, been punished and should be given the benefit of the doubt.\"  Watch a timeline of Kennedy's tragedies, triumphs \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"I think the national repercussions would have been more severe [today],\" Baughman said.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, the national media were dominated by three TV networks and a handful of magazines and newspapers. New media and talk radio would be a \"much more ferocious force\" today, he said.\r\n\r\nMedia reports from the time indicate few mysteries were solved by Kennedy's address.\r\n\r\nThen-Edgartown Police Chief Jim Arena was often lambasted for his handling of the case. He said Thursday he would handle it no differently today except that he would charge Kennedy with vehicular homicide, a charge that did not exist in 1969.\r\n\r\n\"I will always contend that what happened that night was an accident. What happened afterward has never been completely explained,\" said Arena, who is now 79.\r\n\r\nIn his national address, Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to a ferry landing because she was tired. He denied \"widely circulated suspicions of immoral conduct\" and also refuted reports that he was \"driving under the influence of liquor.\"  Watch Kennedy's explanation \u00bb\r\n\r\nKennedy said his unfamiliarity with the bridge, which had no guardrails and met the road at an awkward angle, caused him to drive off the side and into Poucha Pond.\r\n\r\n\"The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water,\" Kennedy said. \"Water entered my lungs and I actually felt the sensation of drowning, but somehow I struggled to the surface alive.\"\r\n\r\nKopechne did not. Kennedy said he dived back into the water several times, \"but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion and alarm.\"\r\n\r\nConceding he did not seek a telephone, Kennedy said he returned to the party and summoned a cousin and friend to the scene. They, too, failed in saving Kopechne, he said.\r\n\r\n\"All kinds of scrambled thoughts -- all of them confused, some of them irrational, many of them which I cannot recall, and some of which I would not have seriously entertained under normal circumstances -- went through my mind during this period,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe asked to be taken to the ferry slip, he said, where he jumped into the water, swam the 500-foot channel back to Edgartown, returned to his hotel room and collapsed.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until morning that he called police, and then, only after he called legal adviser Burke Marshall, he said.\r\n\r\nThe media clamored with questions: Why had Kopechne left her purse and room key at the cottage and told no one she was going home? How did Kennedy get lost on a one-turn trip to the ferry? Was the ferry operating when Kennedy and Kopechne left?\r\n\r\n\"The larger anger about it was the 10-hour lag [in reporting the accident], that he was more concerned about his reputation than this young woman's life,\" Baughman said. \"He didn't take enough time to blame himself and take responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nToday, Baughman said, Kennedy could still survive a Chappaquiddick -- largely because of the Kennedys' clout and because Massachusetts is so enamored with the family -- but it would be tougher with the Slate.coms and Drudge Reports of the world hounding him.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington University's Arterton concurs that, like Jesse Helms' North Carolina or Strom Thurmond's South Carolina, Massachusetts would likely forgive one of its favorite sons today.\r\n\r\nIf Kennedy survived his first re-election, as he did in 1970, he likely would have prevailed in later ones, though it would have been \"very, very difficult to remain in office,\" Arterton said. He also doubts Kennedy would have been able to isolate himself with advisers for days without making a statement.  Watch a newsreel of Kennedy's early years \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"In the cable news era, that would not have been possible,\" he said, explaining that blogs and other new media would have prodded the networks and newspapers. \"There would have been much more effort to dig into that story nationally.\"\r\n\r\nAt the least, Baughman said, \"you'd have maybe a more diverse conversation about Kennedy's culpability and judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThen-Chief Arena remembers the intense criticism of his investigation from his own counterparts.\r\n\r\nDiver John Farrar", "4587": "Melissa Harris-Lacewell", "4588": "the child stars", "4589": "Justin Barker", "4590": "English rugby coach Dean Richards", "4591": "a radiologist failed to highlight the growth of a cancerous tumor on the donor lungs", "4592": "Friday", "4593": "Would You Be My Bride", "4594": "Escalante", "4595": "an album that's a veritable parade of Songs of the Summer", "4596": "Burundi", "4597": "Florida's Gulf Coast", "4598": "about one out of every 150", "4599": "Kelly Clarkson will turn 30 next year.

In March, the total was 923 civilians killed and 1,358 wounded -- a sharp increase over February, when 633 died and 701 were wounded.\r\n\r\nDespite Shiite militants' calls for the Iraqi government to honor a cease-fire, al-Sheikhly said, the crackdown on insurgents will end when the insurgency ends.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there is a timetable for all this. I can't tell that this will end tomorrow or the day after,\" he said. The attacks \"will end when those aspects of violence end.\"\r\n\r\nHe echoed sentiments expressed earlier in the day by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who said the government will not accept the existence of a nongovernment armed force.\r\n\r\nWord of the casualties came as the U.S. military said its highest death toll in seven months reflected an effort by Iraqi militants to reassert themselves after weeks of government crackdowns.
