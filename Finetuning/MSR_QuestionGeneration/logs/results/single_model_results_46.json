He was captured at a hardware store.\r\n\r\nATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The trail for the convicted child molester seemed to grow cold as the police combed his empty apartment.\r\n\r\nJames Maurice Robinson, 25, a confessed sex offender, had been on the run for more than two years, and it looked as if he would elude capture yet again.\r\n\r\nThe authorities huddled in a nearby parking lot to discuss Plan B, an air of disgust hanging over them. James Ergas, the U.S. Marshal helping to lead this operation, acts on a tip. He pulls out his cell phone and calls a hardware store where the suspect may be working.\r\n\r\nUsing a ruse, he begins speaking to the manager and, at one point, Robinson himself gets on the phone and unknowingly talks to the very man trying to catch him.\r\n\r\nGotcha!

The suspect's car, a burgundy, four-door Pontiac Grand Am, sits near a back stairwell.\r\n\r\n\"When we go in there, he's going to run out the back,\" Ergas says.\r\n\r\nHe parks near the front of the building and alerts his backup. Within minutes, the full team arrives. Two take position near the back stairwell.

Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat, stop receiving Holy Communion because of his pro-choice politics.\r\n\r\nKennedy went public Sunday about Tobin's request, originally made in a private letter to Kennedy in 2007. Tobin responded with a statement Sunday followed by his television appearance Monday, in which he acknowledged holding Kennedy to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy.\r\n\r\nThe issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men. A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House.\r\n\r\nKennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language.\r\n\r\nRequests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion \"a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions. He acknowledged \"a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion.\"\r\n\r\nOther Catholics questioned Tobin's stance.\r\n\r\n\"The simple fact is that most bishops don't want to deny communion to politicians, and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II gave communion to pro-choice Italian politicians,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University. \"So the question is, is Bishop Tobin more Catholic than the pope on this?\"\r\n\r\nPoliticians have previously run afoul of Catholic bishops on the abortion issue.

I could not believe that a little girl whose family was supposedly passing as non-Jews would allow their daughter to engage in such an act.\r\n\r\nThe fairy tale nature of the incident was enhanced by the supposed reunion of the couple on a blind date years later when both had moved to America. The story was that they discovered each other's true identity and, after a whirlwind romance, decided to marry.\r\n\r\nSurvivors who had been in the camp with Rosenblat and had kept in touch with him since the end of the war protested that the story could not be true. They wondered why Rosenblat had never mentioned the incident until the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nA number of other historians shared my doubts, which I posted on my blog. As one of the first to express skepticism about this, I became the target of attacks from those who thought I was demeaning the Rosenblats.\r\n\r\nWe doubters could not, however, initially overcome the power of Oprah, on whose show Rosenblat and his wife appeared twice.

Public relations people circulated versions of the story urging recipients to send it on so eventually it would reach millions of people.\r\n\r\nSlowly, thanks to the power of the Internet and the work of some intrepid historians, the hoax was exposed. The publisher pulled the book. The movie producer cried foul, presenting himself as a victim who had been duped.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time such a hoax has been perpetrated. Most of the previous stories have been spread by people who were passing as survivors. In contrast, the Rosenblats were both survivors of the Holocaust. But that fact has now been lost in the shuffle.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the danger of these sorts of hoaxes? First of all, they give ammunition to Holocaust deniers.

In 2003-2004, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as George Bush's most prominent ally on the European continent. Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800.\r\r\n\r\r\nAznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel.\r\r\n\r\r\nYet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels -- and staggering government deficits. The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts.\r\r\n\r\r\nZapatero slunk out of town a little while ago.

But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films.\r\n\r\nMegan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount.\r\n\r\n\"It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,\" he said. \"When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off.\r\n\r\n\"The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],\" Colligan said.\r\n\r\n\"The film is selling itself,\" Greenstein added.\r\n\r\nCritics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews.\r\n\r\nIn giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \"With its this-is-really-happening vibe, 'Paranormal Activity' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clich\u00e9s.

Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites, for instance.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave. Another man's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot, one of his legs was found near a grave, a hip was found inside the grave, his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave.\r\n\r\n\"What we do here is we sort them out,\" said Katzmarzyk, the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker, simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together.  Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP's work \u00bb\r\n\r\nThen, a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives.\r\n\r\nBut DNA can only go so far, and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk's table are those of a man and his 22-year-old son, it cannot say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21-year-old or his 24-year-old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point.\r\n\r\nIt's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related.

On the other end of the spectrum, 37 percent of MySpace members earn less than $50,000 annually, compared with about 28 percent of Facebook users.\r\n\r\nMySpace users tend to be \"in middle-class, blue-collar neighborhoods,\" said Mike Mancini, vice president of data product management for Nielsen, which used an online panel of more than 200,000 social media users in the United States in August. \"They're on their way up, or perhaps not college educated.\"\r\n\r\nBy contrast, Mancini said, \"Facebook [use] goes off the charts in the upscale suburbs,\" driven by a demographic that for Nielsen is represented by white or Asian married couples between the ages of 45-64 with kids and high levels of education.\r\n\r\nEven more affluent are users of Twitter, the microblogging site, and LinkedIn, a networking site geared to white-collar professionals. Almost 38 percent of LinkedIn users earn more than $100,000 a year.\r\n\r\nNielsen also found a strong overlap between those who use Facebook and those who use LinkedIn, Mancini said.\r\n\r\nNielsen isn't the first to find this trend. Ethnographer danah boyd, who does not capitalize her name, said she watched the class divide emerge while conducting research of American teens' use of social networks in 2006.\r\n\r\nWhen she began, she noticed the high school students all used MySpace, but by the end of the school year, they were switching to Facebook.\r\n\r\nWhen boyd asked why, the students replied with reasons similar to Owens: \"the features were better; MySpace is dangerous and Facebook is safe; my friends are here,\" boyd recalled.\r\n\r\nAnd then, boyd said, \"a young woman, living in a small historical town in Massachussetts said to me, 'I don't mean to be a racist or anything, but MySpace is like, ghetto.'\" For boyd, that's when it clicked.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a matter of choice between Facebook and MySpace, it was a movement to Facebook from MySpace,\" she said, a movement that largely included the educated and the upper-class.\r\n\r\nSo why do our online worlds, unencumbered by what separates us in daily life, reflect humans' tendency to stick with what -- and who -- they know?\r\n\r\nA lot of it has to do with the disparate beginnings of MySpace and Facebook, said Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief of Mashable, a blog about social media. Facebook originated at Harvard University and was limited at first to students at approved colleges before opening itself to the public in September 2006.\r\n\r\nMySpace, on the other hand, had a \"come one, come all\" policy and made a mad dash towards monetization, Ostrow said. \"They used a lot of banner ads without regard to the quality, and it really diminished the value [of the site] for the more tech-savvy demographic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the Internet can build bridges between people on opposite sides of the globe, we still tend to connect with the same people through online social networks who we connect with offline, said technology writer and blogger Sarah Perez.\r\n\r\n\"It's effectively a mirror to our real world,\" she told CNN. \"Social networks are the online version of what kids do after school.\"\r\n\r\nThese social-networking divides are worrisome to boyd, who wrote \"Taken Out of Context: American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics.\" Instead of allowing us to cross the boundaries that exist in our everyday lives, these online class differences threaten to carry those boundaries into the future.\r\n\r\n\"The social-network infrastructure is going to be a part of everything going forward, just like [Web] search is,\" boyd said. \"The Internet is not this great equalizer that rids us of the problems of the physical world -- the Internet mirrors and magnifies them. The divisions that we have in everyday life are going to manifest themselves online.\"\r\n\r\nJason Kaufman, a research science fellow with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, examined the Facebook profiles of a group of college students over four years and found that even within Facebook, there's evidence of self-segregation.\r\n\r\nMultiracial students tended to have more Facebook friends than students of other backgrounds and were often the sole connection between white and black circles, Kaufman said.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Kaufman feels that social networks may one day help us overcome our instinct to associate with those who share our income level, education, or racial background.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's fair to say that the Web has great potential to at least mitigate everyday tendencies towards self-segregation and social exclusion,\" Kaufman said. \"In some ways, [Facebook] levels the playing field of friendship stratification. In the real world, you have very close friends and then there are those you just say \"Hi\" to when you pass them on the street.\r\n\r\n\"The playing field is a lot more level in that you can find yourself having a wall-to-wall exchange with just an acquaintance. If you pick up the unlikely friend, not of your race or income bracket, the network may [help you] establish a more active friendship than if you met them in real life.\"\r\n\r\nBut MySpace's users still find something appealing about MySpace that they don't about Facebook, and it may have nothing to do with class or race, blogger Perez said.\r\n\r\n\"It's not just the demographics that have people picking one over the other,\" Perez said. \"It also comes down to what activities you like. If you like music, you'll still be on MySpace. If you're more into applications, then you might go to Facebook because you're addicted to Mafia Wars or whatever.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, boyd isn't as concerned about the reasons behind these divisions online as she is about the consequences of people only networking within their chosen social-media groups.\r\n\r\n\"Friendships and family relationships are socially divided; people self-segregate to deal with racism sometimes,\" she said. \"Okay, fine: We've made a decision to self-segregate, but what happens when politicians go on Facebook and think they're reaching the whole public? What happens when colleges only go on Facebook to promote?\"\r\n\r\nWhen and if that does happen, Mashable's Ostrow said, we'll know perhaps we've given social networks more credit than they're worth. \"When it comes to information, I don't think social networks are the best source for that. The Internet is so open,\" said Ostrow, who believes users would go beyond their networks to search out information online.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to branch out of your social network box, your best option may be Twitter.

I look at my thinner self and think, \"How did I let this happen again?\" Oprah.com: How to prevent weight gain relapse\r\n\r\nIt happened slowly. In February 2007, at 53, I started to have some health issues. At first I was unable to sleep for days. My legs started swelling. My weight started creeping up, first 5 pounds, then 10 pounds. I was lethargic and irritable. My internal clock seemed totally out of whack. I began having rushing heart palpitations every time I worked out. Okay, I've never loved daily exercise, but this was different. I actually developed a fear of working out. I was scared that I would pass out. Or worse. I felt as if I didn't know my own body anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter many trips to various doctors, I received a diagnosis. I had hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course didn't make me lose a single pound) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism (a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain). My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must \"learn to embrace hunger\" or I would immediately gain weight. Believe me, no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the struggle I'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over. I felt completely defeated. I thought, \"I give up. I give up. Fat wins.\" All these years I'd had only myself to blame for lack of willpower. Now I had an official, documented excuse.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid diagnosis felt like some kind of prison sentence.

Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men?\r\n\r\nPowell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father.

The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls.\r\n\r\nAnd when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys.\r\n\r\nThis is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe've got to teach them that you've got to behave.

During the coming months, expedition scientists will compare 40,000 years of oceanic and atmospheric records.\r\n\r\nThe ocean's temperature and carbon dioxide levels are important because of their impact on our atmosphere. The watery part of the world absorbs and stores sixty times more CO2 than the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHuge reservoirs of the ocean's CO2 lurk in its coldest, densest waters (found in the Tasman Fracture and off Greenland). Because cold water releases more CO2 into the air than warm water, the rate at which bottom water rises to the surface has a profound effect on the atmosphere above.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, we had assumed that our climate was relatively stable. After all, for the past 10,000 years -- during which we developed the alphabet, electrical wiring, and microchip necessary for this article -- little has changed.\r\n\r\nBut early-'90s research on Greenland's ice core proved that, over the past 100,000 years, climate stability has been the exception, not the norm. During the last glacial period, global temperatures fluttered up and down by as much as several degrees in as little as a decade. CO2 levels in the atmosphere changed along with the temperature, though more slowly.\r\n\r\nThe researchers' ultimate goal is to see if changes in the ocean followed or proceeded changes in the atmosphere. Adkins suspects that the ocean (and in particular the depths of the ocean) played a part in triggering the climate's sudden fluctuations.\r\n\r\nHe's sure, though, that we're adding more CO2 to the ocean now, in the form of burning fossil fuels", "377": "No changes immediately, but longer term, they can expect to see some significant changes in their benefits and in their conditions of employment.", "378": "a neighbor's house was on fire.\r\n\r\nHe ran outside and saw flames \"shooting off the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must have been like 15-foot flames or higher,\" he said. \"It was just unbelievable.

She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz", "397": "Mary L.

This is our very way of life,\" Jindal told reporters. \"This is our fishing communities, these are some of our coastal communities. We're talking about keeping this oil out of our fragile wetlands.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut as of mid-afternoon, no oil had been found washed up on the islands, said Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP, which owns the damaged well.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"To give you a sense of our ability to respond, we launched 22 vessels,\" Suttles told reporters at a news conference in Mobile, Alabama. Twelve of those vessels were shrimp boats whose skippers have volunteered to assist in the cleanup, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They've been in the area ever since trying to locate that oil and make sure it actually doesn't reach shore,\" Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe edge of the slick was reported to be about 20 miles off the Mississippi Coast, and Landry said it was about 30 miles off the shores of Alabama. Suttles said BP workers expected to close off one of the three leaking points Tuesday, but added, \"I don't believe that will change the total amount of oil that will be leaked.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nStephen Herbert, chef and owner of Abita Springs Cafe on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, said the potential impact was \"tremendous.\" But Herbert, who holds a degree in fish biology and lived in the marshes for 10 years before entering the restaurant business, expressed surprise that the story has become a national one.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I'm really astounded that the rest of the people in the United States really give a flip about this,\" he said. Louisiana's coastal marshlands have been shrinking at the rate of two football fields a day for a quarter-century, he said, \"and nobody gave a flip about that.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHerbert's 16-table restaurant, located 25 miles from New Orleans, specializes in Cajun food, and at least half of his orders are for meals that contain fish. In anticipation of rising prices, he ordered an extra gallon of shucked oysters and another case of shrimp, but that was all his refrigerators could store, the 56-year-old restaurateur said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe estimated 210,000-gallon-per-day flow of oil from the damaged well continued unabated Tuesday, 12 days after the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon sank off Louisiana. The break in the winds kept the slick from advancing much toward the coast, but Jindal said the weather is expected to turn unfavorably Thursday.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe first oil was not expected to reach the shores of the U.S. mainland for another three days, Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs owner of the well, BP is responsible for the cleanup and its costs. It blames Transocean, which it hired to drill the well, for the failure of a critical piece of equipment that was designed to shut off the well in case of emergency.\r\r\n\r\r\nAcross the Gulf Coast, emergency workers and volunteers helped string floating booms across inlets and beaches in an attempt to fend off any advancing oil. Chocolate-colored streaks of oily water could be seen off Dauphin Island, on the Alabama coast. And crew boats that normally supply oil wells were laying booms around Ship Island, off the shores of Mississippi and about 10 miles north of the spill's leading edge.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Capt. Louis Skrmetta, who runs excursions out to the Mississippi Sound barrier islands, said efforts to protect the islands and waterways were inadequate. He said Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour -- who called the spill \"a manageable problem\" Monday -- was doing less to combat the oncoming slick than his counterparts in Alabama and Louisiana.\r\r\n\r\r\nKNOE: Community rallies around rig families\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The governor's leaving it up to BP. They're just not doing enough,\" Skrmetta said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBP hopes to place a four-story-high metal container over part of the leaking drill pipe, a step it says could corral about 80 percent of the leaking oil. The oil would then be pumped to a drill ship on the surface.\r\r\n\r\r\nSuttles said the 70-ton box could be ferried out to the site of the leak by midnight Wednesday, but it will take another two days to place the device on the seabed. Then it must be connected to the drill ship.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Hopefully, we'll be operational within about about six days,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nHundreds of thousands of feet of booms have been strung around the estuaries of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and far western Florida in recent days.

After all, dogs can't read. How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nKathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year.

I am proud to be there to represent them today.\n\nAfter almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.\n\nAfter 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.\n\nBlackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.\n\nAt the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.\n\nThe areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.\n\nAny incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.\n\nIn doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.\n\nBlackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.\n\nThe company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented.\n\nThe worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards.\n\nIn Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force.

We were going do so much after the war ... but it never happened.\"\r\n\r\nTuckwell, who saw action with the 1st Battalion, Dorset Regiment, has since formed a close friendship with Frank Rosier; they are members of the Normandy Veterans Association.\r\n\r\nBoth men say their experiences were so commonplace among their generation that none were able to talk about it until 40 years later.\r\n\r\nRosier told me that what he and the veterans discuss among themselves is very different to what is said in television interviews; but when pushed, he describes what it's like to kill another man.\r\n\r\n\"We could never get our fathers to talk about the first World War, because they were involved in close combat. And twice in the second World War it happened to me.\r\n\r\n\"I came face to face with a German, and I beat him to the draw. I killed him. I sat on the grass and was sick and I cried ... he was some mother's son.\"\r\n\r\nI get the sense that there was a great deal of respect between these soldiers and the Germans on the other side.\r\n\r\nYounger generations try to relate to the scale and the carnage of D-Day through movies like \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\r\n\r\nThe veterans talk of the noise, \"big battleships firing, rocket ships firing, mortars landing, planes strafing, floating artillery and the Germans were totally unsociable about it, they were firing back at us, so there was a hell of a lot of noise there,\" recalls Rosier.\r\n\r\nThey are lighthearted at times, citing the fact that British troops are renowned for their humor -- even in the darkest hours. But it is impossible to gloss over the horror and the danger they faced.\r\n\r\nStanding together in one of the landing crafts at the D-Day museum in Portsmouth, England, Rosier described what it was like to approach Gold beach.  Watch Rosier's full interview \u00bb\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the bullets thundering into the sides of the craft, a ramp on one side hitting a mine and being disabled, and the knowledge that when the front ramp was dropped, the troops inside would be peppered with machine gun fire.\r\n\r\nHe and his infantry were lucky that day - making it onto the beach with minimal loss. But as he told me later, of the 800 men in his infantry, only five survived the war unharmed, \"the rest were killed, missing or wounded.\"\r\n\r\nRosier, who fought with the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, bears the visible scars of battle. He lost an eye to a shrapnel wound -- a 'Blighty one,' meaning that he was taken home to recover in Britain -- and has had to live with the psychological trauma of facial disfigurement.\r\n\r\nBut it's the pain of the ones they left behind that hurts the most.\r\n\r\n\"There was no time to mourn, you didn't have time to mourn,\" said Tuckwell", "1167": "Wednesday", "1168": "inadequate", "1169": "end of World War II", "1170": "The United States", "1171": "the organization does have confidential files, but said they are made confidential in order to protect people who are ineligible to be Scout leaders but who may not have done anything illegal.\r\r\n\r\r\nA Scouts spokesman said that, in recent years, the organization has taken extensive measures to keep abusers out", "1172": "Tuesday", "1173": "Olson", "1174": "Darwin Harbor", "1175": "Pierre Balthazard", "1176": "Tuesday", "1177": "1,200", "1178": "her son's written statement", "1179": "radiation, experts say.\r\n\r\nIn the study of 1,965 patients undergoing the CT scans (also known as cardiac CT angiography), the median exposure was roughly equivalent to 600 chest X-rays, or about 12 milliSievert (mSv) of radiation, according to the report in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\r\n\r\nTraditional angiography -- a technique in which a catheter is snaked though a blood vessel and dye is injected near the heart -- exposes patients to roughly half the dose of CT angiography, or about 5--8 mSv, says study author Jorg Hausleiter, M.D., of the University of Munich in Germany. It's also about the same amount of radiation as other standard cardiac screenings, such as the nuclear stress test.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide range of exposures in the study depending on the medical center and the way the tests were performed.

He said it moved \"up and down like a bouncing ball,\" then disappeared behind a mountain.\r\r\n\r\r\nTwo police officers in Woking, south of London, reported seeing a white light in the sky on Christmas morning 1985.

Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence.\n\nThe state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors.

Half of all French troops outside the country are assigned to NATO military operations.\r\n\r\nOpponents of Sarkozy's move -- who include some members of his party -- believe de Gaulle, not Sarkozy, had it right.

She is appealing her conviction, although her case might not reach a court docket for at least a year.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox told the visitors she trusts in the Italian justice system to resolve her case, Polidori said. However, she said she was scared, and that \"she is often afraid to open [the] newspaper or watch TV,\" because media reports tend to undermine her confidence, Polidori said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Italy USA Foundation \"was established to honor the friendship between Italians and Americans,\" according to its Web site. \"The Foundation is an independent institution that intends to play a bipartisan role on both sides of the Atlantic and whose sole purpose is to promote friendship between Italy and the United States of America.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe foundation's president, Rocco Girlanda, said in a statement on the Web site the delegation visited Knox in her cell in Perugia to check on her condition because of the intense U.S. interest in her case. The delegation brought Knox some English-language books as a Christmas gift, which made her \"really happy,\" Polidori told CNN.\r\r\n\r\r\nProsecutors said Kercher died during a sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher while Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffale Sollecito, and another man, Rudy Guede, sexually assaulted her. Among the evidence against Knox was a knife found in Sollecito's house with Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox's attorneys attempted to cast doubt on those findings, saying the knife did not match Kercher's wounds or a knife imprint left on a bedsheet. They also claimed the DNA sample was too small to be conclusive.\r\r\n\r\r\nSollecito was also convicted in Kercher's death and sentenced to 25 years. Guede was convicted earlier in a separate fast-track trial and is appealing his conviction.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe verdict against Knox drew criticism from some who questioned the process. Kercher's family, however, has said they were satisfied with the jurors' decision.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnox said she misses her family, Polidori said. Her mother, Edda Mellas, told CNN's Larry King earlier this month that her daughter was \"completely crushed, devastated\" by the verdict against her, but she is ready to fight her conviction.\r\r\n\r\r\nKurt Knox, Amanda Knox's father, told CNN she had been a victim of \"character assassination", "1438": "Republican", "1439": "a family member", "1440": "Sarah Palin", "1441": "Watch footage of the plane at the crash site \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe plane", "1442": "Jason Moran", "1443": "$400 million", "1444": "Cairo's Tahrir Square to demand speedy change.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe president they ousted, Hosni Mubarak, faces a possible death sentence if he survives a variety of ailments that have left him hospital-bound since April.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe tourists who once flocked to the pyramids of Giza and the beaches of the Red Sea have yet to return, and the joblessness and poverty that fueled the protests is deeper than before.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe result is a revolution that remains incomplete, with the coalition that formed in Tahrir Square splintering over different visions of a post-Mubarak future. But few dispute that the uprising launched on January 25 has changed an ancient nation in a fundamental way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I am optimistic about the future. We can't go back,\" said Lillian Wagdy, a photographer who was taking part in the protests. \"The wall of fear has fallen, and the people will now demand their rights and stay on the streets.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics, said Egyptians have undergone a \"psychological rapture\" since the revolution.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The psychology of the citizen has changed,\" he said. \"Millions of voiceless people have regained their voices ... It's changed the relationship between sons and fathers and fathers and daughters.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests lasted 18 days, growing despite clashes with police and pro-Mubarak gangs. The armed forces refused to intercede on Mubarak's behalf, and he handed over power to a council of generals on February 11.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe generals suspended Egypt's constitution and named a civilian caretaker government, but remain the final authority in Cairo. That's one of the things that rankles the protesters who have made camp in Tahrir Square since a fresh round of protests in June.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"For me to leave Tahrir, the ruling generals need to listen to our demands and take action to ensure them,\" said Mustafa Sadek, a 16-year-old high-school student taking part in the protests last week. \"We also want a clear schedule, a path to elections and reform. We want a plan that lays out the future.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nRajia Omran, a lawyer and human rights activist, said the revolution \"isn't going too bad.\" But she said patience will be needed for months or even years to come.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It will take 5 to 10 years to evaluate the revolution,\" said Omran, whose group helped organize the first protests. \"Nobody can evaluate it now. Any evaluation now is premature.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nWith liberals, nationalists, leftists and Islamists now split over whether elections or constitutional reforms should come first, Gerges said the protesters are realizing an old lesson: \"Revolutions are messy.\" But those debates are \"a healthy sign that civil society is still alive.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My worry is the cleavages are much deeper than we think, and the question is, will there be a government that will be able to govern in the next two or three years?\" Gerges said. \"If you don't have a consensus on what the future is, you won't be able to govern.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nJumana Shehata, a former media consultant at the National Council for Human Rights, has been critical of the path the revolution has taken. She said secular political parties need more time to organize as a counterweight to the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Right now, the Muslim Brotherhood is the only strong party, and we need more diversity,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Gerges said the Brotherhood has its own divisions, with younger members \"closer to the nationalists and the liberals and the leftists than the old guard.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe military's decision recent decision to delay parliamentary elections until November is a concession to the secular groups, said Shadi Hamid, an analyst at the Qatar-based branch of the Brookings Institution. Hamid said that vote \"will clarify matters,\" demonstrating which of the competing factions \"have the support and capability to push things forward and challenge the military's hold on power.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nShehata took part in the January protests at Tahrir Square and said most Egyptians still support the revolution, but are \"fed up\" with the new demonstrations.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I understand the chaos after a revolution, but I don't see the people in Tahrir now as revolutionaries,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Hamid called the renewed protests a \"frightening turn\" in post-revolutionary Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"More and more, the military staff is being portrayed as an enemy of democracy and an enemy of the transition, at least among the people in Tahrir Square,\" Hamid said. Neither side appears willing to back down, \"and it increasingly looks like the interests of both sides are in some ways impossible to reconcile.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt's military has been the backbone of the state since 1952, when Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser led a coup that toppled the country's monarchy -- and the generals will likely try to keep much of that influence in any new government, said Nathan Brown, a Middle East analyst at George Washington University.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There's no question the military does not want to be responsible for collecting the trash and running the schools and the health-care system and the economy, which is a mess,\" Brown told CNN. \"They don't want civilian oversight when they do go back to the barracks, and they don't want to lose a privileged position in Egyptian political and social life.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut that sort of privilege may be harder to come by in the new Egypt. During the March referendum on changes to the country's constitution, Brown said, newspapers carried stories about VIPs who showed up at polling places where long lines had formed, expecting to be allowed to vote ahead of the hoi polloi.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Every time this happened, they were told, 'Wait a minute, this is a different country now.

He was one of at least 17 police officers who died in the attacks.\n\nBy Saturday evening the death toll from the attacks reached at least 183, federal officials said. State officials are reviewing the higher toll of 195 they released earlier.\n\nAn additional 300 people were wounded, including 23 foreigners, said Vandana Pawar, a Mumbai disaster management official.\n\nThe official death toll does not include the at least 11 gunmen killed.\n\nThe toll is expected to rise as authorities count the casualties inside the Taj Mahal Hotel, whose burned-out lobby was littered with shards of glass.

And then about five minutes later, (we) heard the shooting, and it just went on and on. And my first reaction was, 'Oh, God forgive them,' because I knew that people were being killed. It was just obvious that something terrible was happening.\"\n\nA UK security source told CNN that officials were investigating why two bodies believed to be those of terrorists were found with British identification documents. He said another gunman was captured alive.  Watch a timeline of the attacks \u00c2\u00bb\n\nThe gunmen were in their 20s and appeared well-trained, a member of the Indian navy's commando unit said.

Gen. Eric Schoomaker, the Army Surgeon General told reporters Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nNot surprisingly, the report showed that soldiers with multiple deployments, three or four tours of duty to Iraq or Afghanistan, had much lower morale and more mental health problems than those soldiers who have one or two combat deployments. Increased time at home, however, resulted in improved morale among troops sent back to the field.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe updated survey of soldiers in Afghanistan found post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in soldiers at the same levels of the survey in 2007, but still about double that of the 2005 survey results: 21.4 percent in 2009, 23.4 percent for 2007 and 10.4 percent in 2005, according to the report.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Iraq, where the survey has been done every year, lower numbers were attributed to the decrease in combat action there. The 2009 numbers showed 13.3 percent of soldiers suffering from mental health problems, compared to 18.8 percent in 2007 and 22 percent in 2006.\r\r\n\r\r\nArmy officials said that with the push of more than 20,000 additional troops into the Afghan theater of battle over the last few months, there have been fewer mental health professionals in the field to help. Army officials said the ration was about one mental health professional for every 1,120 soldiers.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo combat the falling morale and lack of mental health professionals in the field, Army officials said the service needs to more than double the number of mental health providers and hopes to have at least 65 more of those providers in the field by December, making the ratio one for every 700 soldiers.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe mental health assessment teams also conducted interviews with soldiers and found a drop in unit morale in Afghanistan to about half of what it was in 2007 and 2005, when about 10 percent surveyed gave top ratings to unit morale. In 2009, that number was 5.7 percent.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report also showed soldiers are seeing more difficulty at home with an increasing number reporting they are getting or considering getting divorced, according to the report.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe overall report was based on almost 4,000 soldiers who filled out anonymous surveys in Iraq and Afghanistan between December 2008 and June 2009.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Iraq, 2,400 soldiers were randomly selected and the results were studied by a mental health assessment team in the combat zone. About 1,500 troops in Afghanistan took the survey, Army officials said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe survey was different from previous years when all types of soldiers were surveyed together. The 2009 survey questioned combat troops and support troops separately, though Army officials said there were few differences in the results.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Friday, the Army also released its latest suicide statistics. They show an increase in the number over this time last year.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Army reported 133 suspected suicides as of October; there were 115 as of October 2008. Of the 133, 90 have been confirmed, and 43 are pending confirmation, according to an Army press release.\r\r\n\r\r\nLast year the Army totaled 140 suicides in its ranks, the highest the service has recorded.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Stigma continues to be one of the most difficult challenges we confront,\" said Brig. Gen. Colleen McGuire, the director of the Suicide Prevention Task Force for the Army.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The more we educate our Army community about the need to get help, the need to get it early, and that a full recovery is often possible, the less stigma we'll see.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Army has implemented a number of suicide prevention programs", "1451": "causing no major injuries but forcing visitors and employees to evacuate, authorities said.\r\n\r\nThe recently remodeled Monte Carlo Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, is shown after and before the fire.\r\n\r\nA bit over an hour after it began, the fire was fully contained, according to the fire departments in Las Vegas and Clark County.\r\n\r\nFirefighters would remain at the hotel until \"the fire is completely knocked out,\" said Clark County Fire Chief Steven M.

When the temper tantrums get physical, airline officials may resort to plastic handcuffs and restraining tape.\r\n\r\nOn a Frontier Airlines flight in July 2007, passenger Tamera Freeman was seen physically abusing her children, who were crying, according to court documents.

He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived and left the children there.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe neighbor, Bob Covington, told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"He rang the doorbell, asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour,\" Covington said. \"I said sure, and he said there'd been some type of emergency, and he took off.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nZinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency, Covington said. He didn't question Zinkhan about the emergency, Covington said, adding that it wasn't unusual for someone in his family to watch the children.\r\r\n\r\r\nAn hour or so later, he said, police arrived and took the children.\r\r\n\r\r\nPolice searched Zinkhan's home on Saturday, but there was no indication of what evidence they might have gathered there.

He declined to detail those irregularities but said authorities are investigating if anything was done about them.\r\n\r\nABC day care officials denied Monday ever being told of safety problems.\r\n\r\nCritics point to cozy business relationships between the owners of the ABC day care and government officials.

Unfortunately, too many of those structures still exist. As attorney general, Eric Holder is charged, in part, with eliminating those violations of law that still create systematic racial inequality.\r\n\r\nIn Holder's optimistic portrayal of modern America, we are a nation fundamentally altered by Brown v. Board of Education; a country that has \"done a pretty good job melding the races in the workplace;\" and a nation whose biggest racial obstacle is making our weekend socializing as congenial as our workweek happy hours.\r\n\r\nMaybe Holder doesn't realize that in many cities and towns the public schools are more segregated today than they were 40 years ago. A recent report from the Chicago Urban League found that African-American children in the city are almost exclusively educated in schools that are more than 85 percent black.\r\n\r\nThese vastly predominantly black schools have fewer resources, fewer extracurricular activities and fewer experienced teachers than their white counterparts.\r\n\r\nChildren from these schools are more likely to drop out or end up incarcerated than to enroll in college.\r\n\r\nSegregation is no longer the law of the land, but America's children continue to be educated in separate and unequal schools. We can't talk our way out of unequal schools.\r\n\r\nHolder's perspective that black and white workers get along easily in the workplace reflects a shocking disregard for contemporary employment realities. African-Americans continue to suffer from extraordinary employment discrimination at every stage of hiring and promotion and in every sector of the job market.\r\n\r\nFor example, my Princeton University colleague, sociologist Devah Pager, has demonstrated that white men with criminal records are more likely to be considered for a job than black men with no criminal past.\r\n\r\nI am deeply concerned that the leader of the Department of Justice seems to believe that our workplaces need dialogue, discourse, and understanding rather than fair hiring practices, equal pay, and transparent promotion procedures. We can't talk our way out of employers who refuse to interview a job candidate if the name on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \"sounds black.\"\r\n\r\nHolder discussed weekend segregation as if it is just a matter of personal recreational choice: White folks go off to NASCAR and black people prefer to watch basketball. But the reason Americans do not share racial vocabulary or opportunities for interracial dialogue is because of deeply entrenched racial residential segregation.\r\n\r\nWe don't spend our weekends together because we don't live in the same neighborhoods. Housing segregation is not just a matter of personal choice. Some real estate agents steer black families away from predominantly white neighborhoods. Some property owners refuse to rent to black families.

Al-Hakim had recently suffered a medical setback, according to his party, which asked people to pray for him in a statement released on Sunday.\r\n\r\nHis body will be sent to Iraq and he will be buried in his hometown of Najaf, one of the holiest cities for Shiite Muslims, al-Husseini said.\r\n\r\nU.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill and the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, issued a joint statement expressing sadness over al-Hakim's death and describing him as \"a national leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,\" the statement said. \"We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.\"  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future \u00bb\r\n\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered his condolences, saying al-Hakim was \"like an old brother.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Maliki credited him for being a \"strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq.\"\r\n\r\n\"His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,\" al-Maliki said in the statement.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim ended his more than 20-year exile in Iran in 2003, when he returned to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his regime.\r\n\r\n\"It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,\" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. \"I was longing to see them. My goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them.\"\r\n\r\nIraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return.\r\n\r\nDuring his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHe took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south.\r\n\r\nSCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word \"revolution,\" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man.\r\n\r\nHis political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did.\r\n\r\nGovernment ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad.\r\n\r\nAnd when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence in Iraq, saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government, which raised concerns about what it called Iran's \"meddling.\" He cited the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries' shared border, historical and cultural relations, and emphasized the desire for strong ties.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim's death comes at a time of violent political turmoil in Iraq. The power of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq party he leaves behind is just as uncertain as the nation he so proudly wanted to serve.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007, and was first", "1871": "an associate professor at the Carey School of Business at Arizona State University", "1872": "the part of the Israeli navy", "1873": "The new \"Footloose", "1874": "criticism that the security strategy", "1875": "French National Assembly", "1876": "shock", "1877": "the October 31 shooting of Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy", "1878": "Moe", "1879": "U.S. troops speak to an Iraqi child in Baghdad on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division will not replace a North Carolina National Guard unit already in Iraq, Lt.

I am proud to be there to represent them today.\n\nAfter almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.\n\nAfter 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.\n\nBlackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.\n\nAt the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.\n\nThe areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.\n\nAny incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.\n\nIn doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.\n\nBlackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.\n\nThe company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented.\n\nThe worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards.\n\nIn Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO.

About half of them wore shiny wedding bands.\r\n\r\nAll had tried to buy a prostitute's services and were caught by police. It was their first offense, and a county court referred them to a one-day program called the John School. It's a program run by volunteers and city officials in conjunction with Magdalene House, a nonprofit that works to get prostitutes off the streets.\r\n\r\n\"Prostitution doesn't discriminate,\" said Kenny Baker, a cognitive behavioral therapist who is the program's director. \"Most of these men don't have a prior criminal history, so our goal is to help these folks understand why they put themselves in a bad position, to prevent it from happening again.\"\r\n\r\nSet in a church in Nashville, Tennessee, the John School is led by former prostitutes, health experts, psychologists and law enforcement officers who talk to -- and at times berate -- the men about the risks of hiring a prostitute.\r\n\r\nProstitution is based on the law of supply and demand. The thinking is: Women won't stop selling sex until men stop buying.\r\n\r\nSo Nashville and a growing number of cities are shifting their focus from locking up suppliers to educating buyers. Across the country, about 50 communities are using John Schools. Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore, Maryland, are among dozens more cities that plan to launch similar programs by the end of the year.  See where the John Schools are \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"It will make them [offenders] see that this is not a victimless crime, and they are contributing to the exploitation of women,\" said Stephanie Davis, policy adviser on women's issues at the mayor's office in Atlanta. \"It's hurting them, the man, and it's hurting their families and its hurting the community.\"\r\n\r\nNo comprehensive effort has been made to track the numbers, but experts estimate 1 million to 2 million prostitutes work in the United States. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Report lists about 78,000 arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice, but experts say those numbers are extremely conservative because many sex workers and johns aren't caught.\r\n\r\nExperts add that easy accessibility to prostitutes and pornography on the Internet are feeding the problem.\r\n\r\nIn most communities, prostitution has been a one-sided battle focused on the women who offer sex. Their customers, when they are arrested, are usually cited for a misdemeanor and fined.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, prostitutes are often charged with more severe sentences and jailed for months, depending on the offense.\r\n\r\nBut in Nashville, the johns' faces are shown on a police Web site.\r\n\r\nFor decades, Nashville battled prostitution by arresting women on the streets and through stings. Still, the problem persisted, irritating business owners and residents.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1990s, Nashville's mayor helped launch the John School with the help of the Magdalene House, public defenders, prosecutors and police officers. Nashville became one of the first major cities in the U.S. to focus on the customers, predominantly men.\r\n\r\nOnly first-time offenders who solicit an adult are eligible for John School. Johns who pick up minors are not eligible and face much tougher sentences.\r\n\r\n\"If you get caught again and you get me, I will guarantee to put you in jail,\" warned Antoinette Welch, a local prosecutor, in speaking to the men in the class. \"I've had men cry to me that they will lose their jobs or their wives, but you're all grown up and you make your own decisions.\"\r\n\r\nThe men listened carefully as Welch talked about their records; many had not yet told their wives or significant others about their arrest.\r\n\r\nIf the john pleads guilty, pays a $250 fee and completes the course without re-offending, the charge can be dismissed after a year. The money paid by the john goes to Magdalene House; the program doesn't cost taxpayers any money. John School models in other communities may differ.\r\n\r\nA woman who called herself Alexis, a 35-year-old former prostitute with dark hair and bright blue eyes, spoke to the men as the class came to an end. Four years ago, she left the streets and now works at a factory.\r\n\r\nBy the age of 10, Alexis had learned to barter with sex with her stepfather. In her 20s, she found herself hooked on drugs and selling her body. She was arrested more than 80 times. She was hospitalized after someone shot her on the job.\r\n\r\nAs she told her story, the men were silent. A few blushed, while others stared at the floor.\r\n\r\n\"These gentlemen are no different than I was on the streets,\" she said. \"I think everyone has to look at the void they are trying to fill.\"\r\n\r\nOne john, a father of two with salt-and-pepper hair, found himself near tears after Alexis spoke. In July, he tried to pick up a prostitute through Craigslist. He said he was depressed and having problems with his wife.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so embarrassed,\" he said. \"These girls are somebody's daughters. I have a daughter.\"\r\n\r\nSome evidence suggests that John Schools are working. A study released in 2008 by Abt Associates Inc. for the federal government looked at the John School program in San Francisco, California. It's one of the largest programs in the country; more than 7,000 johns have attended since 1995.\r\n\r\nAccording to the study, the re-arrest rate fell sharply after the school was launched, and stayed more than 30 percent lower for 10 years afterward.\r\n\r\nBut critics call John School a slap on the wrist. On Saturday, one john abandoned the classroom.\r\n\r\nCarol Leigh, a member of the Sex Workers Outreach Project, a group that promotes decriminalizing prostitution in California, said she doesn't believe the program is an effective deterrent.\r\n\r\n\"John School doesn't do that much,\" said Leigh, who has worked as a prostitute. \"The reality is they aren't spending that much time on the johns and they will just go to other venues. This also doesn't target the violent offenders who are the real problem.\"\r\n\r\nMelissa Farley, head of the nonprofit group Prostitution Research and Education in San Fransisco, believes johns deserve stronger punishment like longer prison sentences.\r\n\r\nA recent study by the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation conducted among johns in Chicago, Illinois, found that 41 percent of them said John School", "2696": "Fabian Cancellara", "2697": "parent company", "2698": "At least 50 people were on the Arrow Stage Lines bus when it crashed on state Highway 163, about five miles north of Mexican Hat", "2699": "Robert Gates", "2700": "Roland Martin", "2701": "HANNOVER, Germany -- Germany maintained the pressure on the Czech Republic in the race for top spot in Group D with a comfortable 4-0", "2702": "yo-yo", "2703": "history of catastrophe", "2704": "Capt.

I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead.\r\n\r\nThe rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition.\r\n\r\nThen there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards.\r\n\r\nThe story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging.\r\n\r\nUltimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\"\r\n\r\nSorry, Rick, I disagree.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control.\r\n\r\nRunning with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nIn one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives", "2765": "Pete Wentz says it's great to see his young fans get energized about the election when they can't even vote.\r\n\r\nCNN.com: What have you been doing in Denver?

The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend.\r\n\r\n\"We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,\" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. \"It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paranormal Activity\" bills itself as \"the first-ever major film release demanded by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago.\r\n\r\nThe studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors. But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending).\r\n\r\nThe movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted.\r\n\r\nParamount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film.\r\n\r\nPeli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,\" Peli said on the video. \"It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a million people have heeded the call.

He said his administration will work \"to support those who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America will do.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the economy and opportunity, he said African nations need to stop focusing on one particular commodity, such as oil or cocoa, and \"promote multiple export industries, develop a skilled work force, and create space for small and medium-sized businesses that create jobs.\"\r\n\r\nHe cited \"our $3.5 billion food security initiative\" and said \"new methods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods to Africa\" is what is needed.  See where Ghana is located \u00bb\r\n\r\nObama also made reference to climate and energy challenges, saying the developed world should work with Africa to confront such problems. He said Africa has much potential to exploit its wind and solar power and geothermal energy and biofuels.\r\n\r\nAs for disease, Obama said strides are being made in dealing with HIV/AIDS and malaria, but \"too many still die from diseases that shouldn't kill them.\" He also indicated that there need to be ways to keep African doctors and nurses from going overseas and creating gaps in primary care.\r\n\r\n\"When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite, and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made.\"\r\n\r\nHe said his administration has committed $63 billion to fight disease, praising the \"strong efforts\" of his predecessor, George W.

Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons.\r\n\r\nHis attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is \"not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything.\"\r\n\r\nA woman identifying herself as Markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. Megan McAllister said Markoff \"is the wrong man\" and \"was set up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,\" McAllister wrote. \"All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!\"\r\n\r\nShe accused Boston police of \"trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the TV stations.

The speculation online doesn't look good.\r\n\r\nEnding on this Season 2 cliffhanger would be a shame.\r\n\r\nWhen Fox picked up this \"Terminator,\" it took on one of the most successful sci-fi franchises in modern entertainment history. It courted \"Terminator\" fans, as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep, high-quality TV storytelling. Ending on this \"what happens now\" cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise's history.\r\n\r\nBut of bigger concern, of course, is that \"The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last. And that's thanks to Josh Friedman, the inspired executive producer.\r\n\r\nFor him, \"Terminator\" isn't about special effects and metal monsters. It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost.\r\n\r\nWithout clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified.\r\n\r\nIt's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in? Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real-life battle against cancer.\r\n\r\nFans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah (Lena Headey) in the new reality. Did she follow her son into the future? If not, what happened to her?\r\n\r\nFriedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now. He packs episodes with twists you don't see coming but make sense in retrospect. He changes up his style, drops lead characters for entire episodes, uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that's simultaneously believable and eloquent. He lets major characters die. And the show's directors coax subtle, nuanced performances from the actors.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't guess any of this from Fox's promotions, which have focused too heavily on Cameron (Summer Glau), the robot who helps protect John Connor (Thomas Dekker), sending the signal that it's a show just for teenage fanboys. Cameron and John's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize: the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life. It's in some ways the reverse of \"Buffy.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Fox may have done better promoting \"Chronicles\" as a family drama and then pairing it with one, rather than \"Dollhouse,\" the latest from \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon. (Insider question for fans: Is Josh Friedman the new Joss Whedon? Weigh in here or here.)\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear how, or if, the new movie \"Terminator: Salvation\" affects the show's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines, there's apparently no overlap and no conflict.\r\n\r\nThe weekly adventures of Sarah and John Connor just aren't done.

F--- them,\" she allegedly said as her husband, Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, bandied about a scheme to withhold state funds from the Cubs' parent Tribune Company unless the owner agreed to fire certain Chicago Tribune employees.\n\nSeven days later, according to the affidavit, she took part in a meeting about whether President-elect Barack Obama would secure a lucrative job for her if her husband appointed Obama's preferred candidate to his vacant Senate seat.\n\nU.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has said Patricia Blagojevich is not the target of the investigation of the governor's alleged attempts to sell Obama's Senate seat, pressure the Chicago Tribune and threaten to withdraw funding from a children's hospital.  Watch what prosecutors say was the first lady's role in alleged scandal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nA glance at her profile on the governor's Web site details a list of philanthropic endeavors, including awareness campaigns for breast cancer, heart disease and food allergies. She also has championed children's health care and literacy, and has parlayed her love for gardening into the State Beautification Initiative.\n\n\"As first lady, she works hard to promote initiatives that will help the families of Illinois bring up happy, healthy and successful children,\" her biography says.\n\nBlagojevich and her family have been part of the Chicago machine for decades. The 43-year-old mother of two is the oldest daughter of Margaret Mell and longtime Chicago Alderman Richard Mell, whose district includes part of Chicago's Northwest Side, where Rod Blagojevich was raised.\n\nPatricia Blagojevich has two siblings, Rich Mell Jr. and Deborah Mell, a gay rights activist and incoming state representative who was arrested in March 2004 while protesting Cook County, Illinois,' refusal to grant her a same-sex marriage license.\n\nDeborah Mell had said she would run for the seat of U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel after Obama tapped him as his chief of staff, but she later withdrew from consideration.\n\nRichard Mell is a well-known Chicago power player who has served on the City Council since 1975. Rod Blagojevich met his future wife in 1988, at one of the alderman's fundraisers.\n\nThe couple married in 1990, and Mell put his political weight behind Rod Blagojevich, who quickly ascended the political ranks.\n\nMell has long been credited as choreographer of that rise, which took Rod Blagojevich from the Cook County state's attorney office to the Illinois General Assembly (1992) to the U.S. House of Representatives (1997) to the governor's office (2003).\n\nRod and Patricia Blagojevich did not move into the governor's mansion in Springfield, opting instead to live 200 miles north in Chicago's upscale Ravenswood Manor neighborhood. There, they live with their daughters -- Amy, 10, and Annie, 4.\n\nAfter Rod Blagojevich was elected to the state's top post, a public feud erupted between the governor and Mell. Tensions reached a flash point in January 2005, when Rod Blagojevich reportedly shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned by Patricia Blagojevich's second cousin.\n\nMell, in an interview with the Chicago-Sun Times, castigated Rod Blagojevich as someone who \"uses everybody, and when there's no more use, he discards them.\" Mell further said that his daughter was wearing \"blinders\" and didn't realize her husband was a manipulative political animal who would \"throw anyone under the bus.\"\n\nMell also leveled a flurry of allegations against his son-in-law's administration -- most notably that Rod Blagojevich's fundraising chief, Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to the governor's political fund, the newspaper reported.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would discuss his 2005 allegations, Mell responded via e-mail, \"My main concern right now is for my daughter and grandchildren. I would rather not discuss this sad situation in the public venue at this time.\"\n\nReports vary on whether the family feud was ever laid to rest. Though fences were mended two years ago, after Mell's wife died of a terminal brain disease, the Sun-Times reported the bad feelings later resurfaced.\n\nThough Mell did not accuse his daughter of improprieties in his well-publicized rant, Patricia Blagojevich", "3232": "October 1991", "3233": "Sunday", "3234": "Almost 12,000", "3235": "toxic materials, which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers.\r\n\r\n\"People living and working on and around the dump sites, many of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health, including cancer, damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children,\" Kim Schoppink, Toxics Campaigner at Greenpeace, told CNN.\r\n\r\n\"The open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins.\"\r\n\r\nNo studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in Nigeria, but in 2008 a Greenpeace report on similar dumps in nearby Ghana confirmed that high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon.\r\n\r\nA Chinese academic report published in \"Environmental Health Perspectives\" in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby.\r\n\r\nThere is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for \"e-waste\" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nSome of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 a Greenpeace study, \"Not in My Backyard\", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent.\r\n\r\nExtrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites.\r\n\r\nBut much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped.\r\n\r\nIt's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading.\r\n\r\nThe volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste.\r\n\r\nEach one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years.\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market.\r\n\r\n\"Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,\" said Schoppink.\r\n\r\n\"It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries", "3236": "Hairspray\" soundtrack while driving. \"It seemed ridiculous, but that's what initially helped me the most.\"\r\n\r\n\"The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being,\" says Baraz. \"In other words, it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good.\" The first and most important step, he says, is intention: making the decision to be happy.\r\n\r\nRobert Holden, Ph.D., author of \"Happiness Now! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast\" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. \"Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow. For centuries, optimists and pessimists have argued over who's right, and the answer is they both are; each sees what they're looking for.

He woke up early each morning to dutifully trudge to job sites around New Jersey on the hottest and coldest of days.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the afternoon, Edgar coached wrestling. At night, he treated himself to training in his true passion: mixed martial arts.\r\r\n\r\r\nSoon Edgar told his family he wanted to quit plumbing and become a professional fighter.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I'm not one to just drop everything and chase something that I know is not 100% sure,\" Edgar said, \"so I kept training and kept working to support myself, and eventually I got a call from the UFC,\" said Edgar, referring to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. It's the biggest mixed martial arts, or MMA, league in the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\nEdgar, whose UFC nickname is \"The Answer,\" suffered his first loss in 2008 after eight straight victories in his professional career. That loss came at the hands of undefeated opponent Gray \"The Bully\" Maynard.\r\r\n\r\r\nEdgar and Maynard's second fight in January ended in a draw. With 13 wins, one loss and one draw, Edgar is the league's lightweight champion, a title he earned in 2010.\r\r\n\r\r\nNow, just before his third match with Maynard on Saturday night in Houston, the 29-year-old Edgar said he was confident that he could beat Maynard for the first time.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My main goal in between each fight is to become a different fighter, and I think I did that,\" Edgar said. \"As long as I show up and utilize all the improvements that I made, I'm going to come out the winner.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe sport first roped in Edgar while he watched it on television as a teen growing up in Toms River, New Jersey.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I was pretty much content with wrestling, but I wanted to try a different avenue and still compete,\" he said. \"I thought MMA was the perfect place for me.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHis mother and stepfather, he recalls, were not initially as excited by the idea of him making a living as a fighter. But once he joined the UFC in 2005, they gave their support. \"They haven't missed a fight since,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nOriginally called no-holds-barred fighting, variations of MMA date back to at least the late 1800s. It has transformed from a mostly underground sport that Sen. John McCain, R- Arizona, once called \"human cockfighting\" into a multibillion dollar, global industry.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's the fastest-growing sport in the world,\" says Mike Straka, a long-time MMA journalist and broadcaster who now works in the fight industry.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's the only sport that was really birthed during this generation,\" said Straka, who works at Authentic Brands Group, a developing and licensing firm, and host of a program on the company's Tapout News.\r\r\n\r\r\nCalifornia and New Jersey were the first of the major market states to regulate MMA, in 2000. Most other states have followed but the sport remains illegal in New York, Connecticut and West Virginia.\r\r\n\r\r\nA focused and steady demographic has helped MMA \"quickly become more accepted by the mainstream sports business, evolving from its relatively rogue status at its inception,\" said Rick Horrow, a visiting expert on sports law at Harvard Law School, who co-authored Beyond the Scoreboard.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile the fan base is mostly youthful and is especially popular among 18-to 34-year-old men, a lot of women get into it, says Ariel Helwani, a reporter for AOL's MMAFighting.com.\r\r\n\r\r\nReportedly worth $2 billion, the UFC says it broadcasts in more than 20 languages to nearly 600 million homes in 132 countries. Up to 300,000 people purchased the last Edgar-Maynard fight on Pay-Per-View, according to the Wrestling Observer. Saturday night's fight in HD sells for $54.99.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile MMA fighters might not bring in the reported millions per bout that heavyweight boxers such as Floyd Mayweather versus Victor Ortiz saw last month, how much they earn depends on who they are and what stage of their career they are in, Straka says.\r\r\n\r\r\nFight purses range from as little as $10,000 to $500,000 for more experienced and popular fighters, he says. For stars such as Edgar, there is also big money from sponsorships and endorsements. \"Frankie Edgar would never need to get another job if he retired tomorrow,\" Straka", "3383": "medical supplies", "3384": "Bear Grylls", "3385": "Nobody was injured", "3386": "Tuesday", "3387": "abstinence education", "3388": "California voters could decide next year whether to abandon the death penalty", "3389": "Somerset County", "3390": "The wedding", "3391": "nearly 22%", "3392": "unwanted projects", "3393": "O'Keefe", "3394": "T-Mobile system", "3395": "Alvaro Uribe", "3396": "the United States offer", "3397": "Two", "3398": "a 93-foot fishing vessel", "3399": "his posted", "3400": "set up a pottery workshop", "3401": "Paloschi", "3402": "Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Cuban", "3403": "Solidarity", "3404": "10:30 a.m.", "3405": "The tests", "3406": "detailed conditions they [Congress] have imposed on the overall JSF program", "3407": "western Sudan's Darfur region", "3408": "said", "3409": "works for you", "3410": "Michelle Obama's family has roots.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's not exactly \"Gone With the Wind,\" but what makes this overgrown 3,300 acres of marsh and pine trees stand out is this: The family of first lady Michelle Obama believes her great-great grandfather was held as a slave here and labored in the mosquito-infested rice fields.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt makes Friendfield Plantation a symbol of something more than servitude.

SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHe took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south.\r\n\r\nSCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word \"revolution,\" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man.\r\n\r\nHis political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did.\r\n\r\nGovernment ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad.\r\n\r\nAnd when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence in Iraq, saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government, which raised concerns about what it called Iran's \"meddling.\" He cited the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries' shared border, historical and cultural relations, and emphasized the desire for strong ties.\r\n\r\nAl-Hakim's death comes at a time of violent political turmoil in Iraq.

However, in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe murky story began in June of this year, when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena, Italy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren's chief designer Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan's wife, Trudy Coughlan, had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren's Woking headquarters. An employee of the copy shop, suspicious that confidential data was being copied, blew the whistle to Ferrari.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney, a friend and former colleague of Coughlan's (the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s). Stepney had been the team's chief mechanic, but in February took his new role as the team's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena, Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari issued the following press statement:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal, concerning the theft of technical information. Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut now the FIA is in possession of new evidence. Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso. On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa, Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated: \"The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession, or that such drivers have recently been in possession, of written evidence relevant to this investigation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe letter continued: \"I can confirm, given the importance of this issue, that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the International Sporting Code or the Formula One regulations. However, in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information, serious consequences could follow.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFive days later the WMSC announced it was to reconvene \"following the emergence of new evidence\", in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nOther rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa in practice leading up to the Monaco Grand Prix. Stepney has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther drama overshadowed Alonso and Hamilton's one-two on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. Modena's public prosecutor, Giuseppe Tibis, issued a legal notice -- known as an 'avviso di garanzia' -- that six McLaren employees were under criminal investigation . The six included McLaren supremo Ron Dennis, managing directors Martin Whitmarsh and Jonathan Neale, technical director Jonathan Neale and designer Rob Taylor as well as Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis outcome has put a dark shadow McLaren's return to winning ways.

[D]ropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American.\"\r\n\r\nThe president's commitment to education is truly remarkable, considering the enormous array of policy challenges confronting the administration. From health care and the economic crisis, to global warming and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration is beset by controversies that will not be easily resolved.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the president and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, have not allowed education to be ignored or placed on the back burner says a great deal about their recognition of its central importance to our nation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the administration navigates its way into the policy debates that are swirling over the future of education, it would be wise for it to proceed with caution.\r\n\r\nThe administration has already staked out positions on a number of issues -- charter schools and merit pay for teachers being two of the big ones -- which run the risk of generating additional controversy in the polarized debates over how to reform education.\r\n\r\nIf these issues and the stimulus money being made available under the Race to the Top (RTT) program are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue. The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers.\r\n\r\nThe current policy debates over the direction of education are typically presented as battles between the reformers, led by school superintendents like Joel Klein of New York and Michelle Rhee of Washington, D.C., and the defenders of the status quo, most often presented as the powerful teacher unions and other elements of the education establishment.\r\n\r\nWhile anyone familiar with the current debates knows that the differences between the two sides are real and profound, a protracted battle over the direction of education reform is not a good thing either for the administration or for those who genuinely want to see improvement in public education.\r\n\r\nInstead of choosing sides, it would be wise for the administration to do all it can to find common ground between the opposing camps as it formulates new policy initiatives.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of requiring states to adopt some form of merit pay for teachers -- a measure to which both the teachers' unions, the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have already declared their opposition -- the administration could encourage states to adopt school-based formulas that reward increases in student achievement.\r\n\r\nThis is similar, though not identical, to the approach taken in New York City, one that encourages collaboration among teachers and recognizes the importance of evidence that children are learning.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, rather than touting charter schools as the solution to public education, the administration should treat the best charters as models of innovation that provide educators with the flexibility to implement new strategies. This is a subtle but important distinction that has been lacking in many of the administration's pronouncements about charter schools.\r\n\r\nUnlike the public schools, many charter schools find ways to avoid serving the most disadvantaged students, and their teachers often work a longer day and longer school year without a contract.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of the best charters are subsidized by private philanthropists and are able to spend considerably more per pupil than traditional public schools. These facts should not be used to negate the accomplishments of the excellent charter schools that have emerged in many large cities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is far more likely that struggling public schools in these same cities would be more open to learning from the charters' accomplishments if they were not cast as competitors.\r\n\r\nFinally, the president has championed the idea of \"promise neighborhoods\" as a way to increase the availability of social services to children in high poverty communities, using as a model the Harlem Childrens Zone.\r\n\r\nIf this initiative is to result in lasting benefits to children, it will need to be combined with creative approaches to reforming urban public schools that re-formulate how we think about standards and focus attention more intently on how to deliver quality instruction to children.\r\n\r\nWith dropout rates at over 50 percent in several of our nation's cities, the administration must realize that tinkering at the margins with No Child Left Behind will not deliver the change we need.\r\n\r\nThe president entered office promising to bring a new kind of politics to the nation", "4014": "above 60 percent of the wild giant panda population", "4015": "19.8", "4016": "southeastern Utah", "4017": "64 percent", "4018": "Orlando International Airport", "4019": "Helmand province", "4020": "MV Amira", "4021": "Erik Prince, the chairman and CEO of Blackwater USA, appeared Tuesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nErik Prince, CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA, is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing.\n\nThe committee convened amid an FBI", "4022": "Turkey", "4023": "Harry Reid of Nevada", "4024": "President Obama", "4025": "President Obama and Adm.

The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"\r\n\r\nIt's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.\r\n\r\nThe prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)\r\n\r\nDafoe and Gainsbourg", "4085": "conspicuous consumption", "4086": "William Blount, 55, a Montgomery, Alabama, investment banker, and Albert LaPierre", "4087": "NAPLES, Italy -- Udinese", "4088": "more than 900", "4089": "CNN) -- Do not go backstage", "4090": "4 million", "4091": "choking", "4092": "Calderon and local political and civic leaders", "4093": "several previous cases", "4094": "President Obama and Adm.

A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House.\r\n\r\nKennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was \"not the Catholic candidate for president,\" but \"the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica.\r\n\r\nPatrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language.\r\n\r\nRequests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion \"a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions. He acknowledged \"a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion.\"\r\n\r\nOther Catholics questioned Tobin's stance.\r\n\r\n\"The simple fact is that most bishops don't want to deny communion to politicians, and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II gave communion to pro-choice Italian politicians,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University. \"So the question is, is Bishop Tobin more Catholic than the pope on this?\"\r\n\r\nPoliticians have previously run afoul of Catholic bishops on the abortion issue. Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann asked Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to stop receiving communion when she was a pro-choice governor of Kansas, and former St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke said in 2004 he would deny communion to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for being pro-choice.\r\n\r\nBrian McLaren, a longtime Christian pastor who has written a book coming out next year called \"A New Kind of Christianity,\" said politicizing religious views limits the perception and, eventually, the impact of a church's teachings.\r\n\r\n\"Both Catholics and Protestants have allowed themselves to be pushed into this kind of binary, either-or thinking\" on abortion and homosexuality, McLaren said. \"It's disturbing for me as a non-Catholic to see the Catholic Church possibly risking its moral authority on a number of other issues by only focusing on abortion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic church strongly opposes abortion, which has been legal across the United States since 1973. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops lobbied for tight restrictions on federal funding of abortion in the health care bill the House passed earlier this month.\r\n\r\nIn an October interview, Kennedy criticized the bishops for threatening to oppose the health care bill", "4098": "high sulfur emissions", "4099": "Stuttgart", "4100": "her manager Norio Sasaki", "4101": "the international wildlife community over damage to the animals' habitat", "4102": "food, water and clothing", "4103": "three", "4104": "Madrid challenged the original ruling made by European football's governing body last week.\r\n\r\nRegulations specify that clubs", "4105": "John McCain as a candidate who is out of touch with the middle class.\r\n\r\nSen.

McCain talk about the struggles that middle class families are facing every day,\" Obama said at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe economy took the lead in Friday night's presidential debate, as both candidates highlighted their plans to bring the United States out of what some are describing as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\r\n\r\nMcCain on Sunday brushed off Obama's latest line of attack, saying he has \"bigger things to worry about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who does he think I was talking about when I said 'people on Main Street'?

Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces, it says, \"the government of Pakistan's authority in the area continued to be challenged.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nRonald Schlicher, the State Department's acting coordinator of counterterrorism, told reporters the Obama administration has \"real concerns\" that al Qaeda's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We have a real sense that it's happening, but we have imperfect knowledge of what they're doing,\" he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nPakistan's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The deal, criticized by the United States, allowed the Taliban to implement Islamic law, or sharia, in the region in exchange for an end to fighting.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe recent operations are part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan. The strikes have rankled relations between the two countries.\r\r\n\r\r\nPakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters, communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country's counterterrorism efforts.\r\r\n\r\r\nPresident Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is \"gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nSpeaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office, Obama said the United States has \"huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable\" and doesn't end up a \"nuclear-armed militant state.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is \"very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships' inability to confront that threat,\" according to his chief spokesman.\r\r\n\r\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have called Taliban gains in Pakistan an \"existential threat\" to the country.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, in November, attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary, amaat ud-Dawa. Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups' camps and made several arrests, the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report says Afghanistan is plagued by \"an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks,\" despite the efforts of NATO forces and the Afghan government.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The anti-government insurgency remained a capable, determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority,\" the report warns. Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses, the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers \"remained undiminished.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated,\" it says. \"Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan, along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking, have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nIran is also a source of training to the Taliban \"on small-unit tactics, small arms, explosives and indirect-fire weapons,\" the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members,\" it says.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year, \"there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country, including a decrease in civilian casualties, enemy attacks, and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year,\" the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008, down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007, Travers said. He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009, although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April.\r\r\n\r\r\nAlthough the threat from al Qaeda in Iraq \"continued to diminish\" due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding, al Qaeda continued to benefit from safe haven in Somalia and has strengthened its North African operations, the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt notes a sharp increase in attacks by al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa. In Algeria, many of the attacks were blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, whose tactics \"appeared to be influenced by [al Qaeda's] experience in Iraq.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report also warns \"the security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both Western and Yemeni interests,\" culminating in the September 17 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa that killed 18.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Recruitment for al Qaeda in Yemen (AQY) remained strong, and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) and suicide vests indicated a high level of training, coordination, and sophistication by Yemen's terrorist leadership,\" the report says.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report calls the government's response to the terrorist threat", "4111": "several", "4112": "Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo arrived Wednesday at the International Criminal Court in The Hague", "4113": "Donna Brazile", "4114": "Knox and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito", "4115": "Ian Khama", "4116": "a form of torture", "4117": "Olympics", "4118": "Hunter", "4119": "the past two days of demonstrations rose to 20", "4120": "shut down a Joliet, Illinois, landfill owned", "4121": "Chester County District Attorney Joe Carroll said.\r\n\r\nCoatesville has been hit by a string of arsons in recent months and although the arson task force investigating those cases made Monday's arrest, officials did not link the arrest to any other arson cases.\r\n\r\nThe criminal complaint against Tracey lists nine charges stemming from a fire set to a homeowner's porch swing and a fire set in another homeowner's trash can.

Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where.\r\n\r\nOfficials at Forest Lawn won't disclose where Jackson's body is being buried. If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months.\r\n\r\nThere has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch.\r\n\r\nIf a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite.\r\n\r\n\"If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,\" said Steve Goldstein, author of L.A.'s Gravesite Companion: Where the VIP's RIP. \"He'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over Marilyn.\"\r\n\r\nFame follows celebrities in life and in death.\r\n\r\n\"There's always a fascination with celebrities, but it's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses,\" says Jim Tipton, founder of findagrave.com, a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens. \"But once they are interred into the ground, anyone who wants to go can go.\"\r\n\r\nTipton's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago, when he saw mobster Al Capone's grave in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. He and many others who are avid about visiting celebrity and historical graves dub themselves \"grave hunters.\"\r\n\r\nThey seek the dead for various reasons. Some go out of simple curiosity. Others are history lovers. Many are fans who deeply admired the stars. Some say they feel a connection to the celebrities by standing beside their graves.\r\n\r\nAt Elvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, guests visiting the grave can stay at the retro Heartbreak Hotel and visit the museum to learn more about the King of Rock and Roll.\r\n\r\nWestwood Memorial Park and Cemetery in Los Angeles houses Hollywood notables including sex symbol Marilyn Monroe and comic Rodney Dangerfield.  The most recent celebrity to be buried there is actress Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer last month. Visitors can access the cemetery easily, and even tour buses drop by.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a product of that era, of Charlie's Angels,\" said Jayne Osborne, a self-proclaimed grave hunter who visited Fawcett's grave a week ago. The 48-year-old education administrator began searching for celebrity graves in the early 1970s. Since then, she's visited hundreds of celebrity resting places in Southern California. \"I wanted to pay my respect.\"\r\n\r\nAt Westwood, the most popular grave site remains Monroe's. Fans often decorate her grave with flowers and cards. Her headstone is slightly darker than the others from so many fans touching it, grave hunters say.\r\n\r\nIn P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the largest cemetery in Paris, France, American singer Jim Morrison's grave is tattooed with graffiti and artwork. Morrison fans like to leave candles, poems and gifts as tokens of appreciation.\r\n\r\nAt one point, fans were so rowdy that a stone block was put in place in an attempt to seal the grave from fans trying to unearth it. After unsuccessful attempts by French authorities to move the tomb to another site, security officers were placed at the grave.\r\n\r\nSimilar trouble plagued Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia, where members of the Allman Brothers Band were buried in the early 1970s. Thousands of fans journeyed to visit the graves and party there, leaving behind cigarette butts and empty alcohol bottles. Relatives fought to have an iron fence erected around the graves.\r\n\r\nSome celebrity graves prove tempting to visitors, like that of heartthrob actor James Dean.

It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging.\r\n\r\nAl-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague, the court says.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes.

To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations.\r\n\r\nThe militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength.\r\n\r\nIn his appeal to the court Monday, Moreno-Ocampo complained that the judges' standard for adding the genocide charge to the warrant is too high.\r\n\r\nThe judges want him to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that al-Bashir committed genocide, but that level of proof is not required for a warrant, which only requires a reasonable inference of guilt, he said.\r\n\r\n\"They are requesting a level of evidence that is the level of evidence required at the trial stage, not at the beginning of the process,\" Moreno-Ocampo said.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason that prosecutors cannot provide more evidence at this stage is because al-Bashir is attacking witnesses who are willing to provide information to prosecutors, Moreno-Ocampo said. Presenting more evidence could endanger the victims, he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's a legal issue,\" he said. \"The judgment by itself is very important, but in addition I cannot accept this wrong legal standard.\"\r\n\r\nThe judges believe the crimes that Moreno-Ocampo classifies as genocide instead fall under the category of crimes against humanity, he said.\r\n\r\nEven if Moreno-Ocampo were successful in adding genocide to the warrant, he would still face a difficult task in proving the charges at trial, said Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar Association.\r\n\r\n\"Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet (than war crimes and crimes against humanity) because you have to show in proving genocide that there was an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race,\" Ellis told CNN. \"Obviously the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Moreno-Ocampo loses the appeal, Ellis said, it would not minimize the seriousness of the case.\r\n\r\n\"The charges that have been (alleged", "4405": "South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Within minutes, the full team arrives. Two take position near the back stairwell. Ergas and other team members, dressed in black flak jackets, enter the front door at 11:19 a.m.\r\n\r\nRobinson doesn't have a chance. He tries to run, but slips.

And the way she's done it? It's largely through the fashion choices she's made.\r\n\r\nEach of her predecessors has brought a unique perspective and personality to the east wing of the White House, helping to shape how the nation views the president and how the world views the nation.\r\n\r\nThe use of fashion and image as a political strategy is an underrated factor. While Washington's political cognoscenti debate the successes and failures of the young Obama presidency, one half of Washington's newest power couple fine tunes fashion as a political strategy -- and it's working for her.  See photos of Michelle Obama's fashion \u00bb\r\n\r\nThe fashion authorities who are gathered this week in New York for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, more than seven months into the Obama presidency, are watching Michelle Obama's redefinition of the role of first lady with professional and personal interest.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary standard for the job was set decades ago by Jacqueline Kennedy, who had both a high sense of fashion and the style to pull it off. Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the historian at the National First Ladies' Library, points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed, liked European style and had American designers copy it. She even went as far as to personally design her own outfits on three important state occasions, including her famous White House dinner for Nobel laureates, while letting other designers take the credit.\r\n\r\nThe comparisons between Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Obama are as apt as the comparisons between their husbands. Michelle Obama comes across as feminine yet strong, professional and, unlike Mrs. Kennedy, approachable. She's a thoughtful presence on the national stage, but it's a very different kind of style from what we associate with Jackie Kennedy, who displayed a style of wealth, youth and glamor to an adoring middle class.\r\n\r\nMrs. Obama, on the other hand, is portrayed as a take-charge woman who is sensitive to today's economic realities. Not stylish in her own right, she blends advice from her noted advisers to appear independent and progressive, yet \"in touch.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Jackie was high fashion, Michelle Obama is trendy but traditional. And that approachability extends to her personal style as well, her advisors having absorbed the lesson that the first lady's style is all too easily linked to her husband's presidency. Ronald Reagan's opponents used his wife Nancy's interest in fashion and her intent to look like the wife of a president, rather than mimic the school-marmish attire of her predecessor, as a gateway through which to attack the president.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reagan's wardrobe choices, especially her designer Adolfo dresses, were used to make her husband seem insensitive to the poor and hungry. Mrs. Obama has avoided making the same mistake during the worst economic times in recent memory.\r\n\r\nShe seems to have made a calculated decision to avoid that trap by focusing on emerging designers, like Jason Wu for her inaugural gown or choosing to wear trendy, off-the-rack clothes like the J. Crew gloves, sweater and skirt she chose for her husband's inauguration.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever the style mavens have to say about that, it produces political benefits. J. Crew's shares jumped 10 percent within 24 hours after the nation saw her in its clothing, which prompted NBC's Conan O'Brien to suggest the president consider wearing a Buick.\r\n\r\nAs Women's Wear Daily media reporter Stephanie Smith says, this child of Chicago's South Side has become \"the biggest celebrity in the world.\" Forbes lists her among the \"Most Powerful Women,\" and there's no doubt she's expanding the boundaries of perceptions surrounding the role of a \"traditional\" first lady, balancing her visits to homeless shelters and military bases with taking part in her children's soccer games.\r\n\r\nAs The New York Times reported, Mrs. Obama \"pointedly controlled her look on the covers of People, Essence, More and O, Oprah Winfrey's magazine. Editors at Essence, who suggested colors, styles and accessories, said her staff did not call to acknowledge their overtures. ... Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor-in-chief of More... said Mrs. Obama refused to wear anything other than her own clothes for their October cover. 'She wanted none of that. She was creating the cover. She was creating the image. There's definitely a will of steel there.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Anthony, the general public's fascination with Michelle Obama spills over and helps the administration. To him, everything the media and the public criticize or praise is visual. \"It's not anything she's saying or doing. That's perhaps somewhat tactical. If she's unpopular based on her clothes choices, the White House can say it's really not of importance.\"\r\n\r\nIMG executive Fern Mallis, the creative inspiration behind New York's Fashion Week, says \"most first", "4572": "U.S. ambassador", "4573": "an emotional Kiley Barnes", "4574": "debris", "4575": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Indian government doctors Thursday eased the protruding heart of a 10-day-old baby boy back into his body in what they called a critical but successful surgery.\r\n\r\nSurgeons in New Dehli", "4576": "The U.S. military said Marines and police", "4577": "requiring importers to channel media products", "4578": "China and Russia", "4579": "Those sources say women candidates will be at or near the top of the list of finalists", "4580": "bigger fines", "4581": "paid firefighter", "4582": "Shelby's supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 puts out 450 horsepower and will easily exceed 150 mph.

Black leads the Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus.\r\n\r\nThere was no comment from the White House as of Tuesday afternoon.\r\n\r\nBlack rebuked Goforth but didn't dismiss her.\r\n\r\n\"I want to be sure that everyone understands that the communication was sent without my knowledge,\" Black said Tuesday afternoon. \"It absolutely does not represent the beliefs or opinions of my office. I want to be very clear about that.\"\r\n\r\nThe senator said as soon as she found out about the e-mail, she consulted the Legislature's human resources office, then followed their advice.\r\n\r\n\"Ms. Goforth did get a verbal reprimand as well as a very strongly worded reprimand, written, that was put in her file that if this should ever occur again, that she would be terminated,\" Black said.

People started looking at her in a different light, and she was judged as a less serious candidate.\r\n\r\nSaturday's skit portraying President Obama as a man who made a lot of promises and hasn't been able to fulfill many -- if any -- has been analyzed over and over with a constant rerun of the \"SNL\" clip.\r\n\r\nIn the comedy skit, the president is asked about unrealized campaign promises, including closing Gitmo, combating global warming, allowing openly gay people to serve in the military, withdrawing from Iraq, improving the status of the fight in Afghanistan, reforming health care and several others. On screen the response on a check list was: that each item was \"not done.\"  Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous. Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president.  See how 'SNL' has portrayed presidents \u00bb  President Gerald Ford, a gifted athlete, could never overcome the image of a bumbling, clumsy man who banged his head constantly after the hilarious portrayal of him by Chevy Chase. The senior Bush, George H.W., was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey, and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy, inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions.\r\n\r\nBut the real question being debated on cable TV because of the \"SNL\" parody is this: \"Has the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?\"\r\n\r\nI can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats will add pensively to the words: \"Not Done\" from the \"SNL\" skit, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans would add assertively : \"Not ever!\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \"Camelot II\"; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care.\r\n\r\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise.

According to Iraq's Interior Ministry, 969 civilians died and 1,750 were wounded during April. In March, the total was 923 civilians killed and 1,358 wounded -- a sharp increase over February, when 633 died and 701 were wounded.\r\n\r\nDespite Shiite militants' calls for the Iraqi government to honor a cease-fire, al-Sheikhly said, the crackdown on insurgents will end when the insurgency ends.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there is a timetable for all this.

Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,\" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: \"He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, \"Please don't be mad at me.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Jackson disputed the word \"beat,\" but didn't question Michael's account.\r\n\r\n\"I whipped him with a switch and a belt,\" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, \"I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick.\"\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions.\r\n\r\n\"We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,\" he said. \"I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the \"chitlin circuit\" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them \"the last big stars to come off my assembly line,\" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site.\r\n\r\nThe group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a collaboration,\" Gamble said. \"They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians.\"\r\n\r\nHuff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a \"fantastic meal\" cooked by Katherine Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing but respect for the father,\" added Gamble. \"He's a great man. He made something out of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nEven during that era, however, Michael was standing out. Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded.

As in games past, Nathan is a treasure hunter who follows clues to find lost riches in far-off lands and gets help from other characters in his missions.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe game's storyline follows the path of \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" the T.E. Lawrence book that inspired the epic movie \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" Amy Henning, the writer for the \"Uncharted\" series, pulls elements from Lawrence's book and weaves them into a stunning narrative about Nathan's search for a lost city called Iram of the Pillars.\r\r\n\r\r\nKeith Guerrette, lead visual effects artist from Naughty Dog, said Henning really opened up the characters in the game and delves deeply into Nathan's past as well as his connections to his companions. While some of the story is told in flashbacks, it never feels disjointed or out of place and flows with the action in the game.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe pace, for the most part, is quick and occurs over several different types of environments. From a vast desert to historical chateaus, the scenes are beautifully rendered and help deepen the moment. There were a couple of missions that bogged down the story in places, but those were few and far between.\r\r\n\r\r\nMany times, I felt like I was in an \"Indiana Jones\" movie. There were moments when the gameplay was very similar to what I've seen on the big screen. For example, one mission had me chasing after a caravan transporting my longtime friend, Victor Sullivan, through a narrow cavern in a scene that was reminiscent of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nLike Dr. Jones, Nathan has to solve puzzles and use his journal to reference solutions. The puzzles were not extremely challenging once the clues in the journal were deciphered. There are other little touches that are Jones-esque, but they add to the story rather than taking away from it. The action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe dialogue helps keep the mood light as character banter flows naturally and feels like what it is -- conversations between people who don't take themselves too seriously but have experienced life-changing events. There is humor, caring, concern and sarcasm that one would expect from longtime friends. It feels natural and gets the player emotionally involved.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"We've been building up to this one,\" Guerrette said. \"We went in thinking, 'How can we take our tech and art and make them even better?' \"\r\r\n\r\r\nThere are subtle effects in the environment, like shadows from a fire, ripples in water and disappearing footprints in sand. But the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which Nathan takes on his enemies while the background moves.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuch of Nathan's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings, like the \"Assassin's Creed\" games. That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe game's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times. Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles. Melee was improved (I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory.\r\r\n\r\r\nStealth has become a more effective tool in some missions. There was one mission, however, where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill. It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance.\r\r\n\r\r\nTargeting specific areas on enemies also didn't seem to matter. There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down. Yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy's arm to get him to collapse.\r\r\n\r\r\nNathan can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way. The audio is funny, but the effects are devastating.\r\r\n\r\r\nA split-screen co-op version (a fan request) offers a unique story with the chance to unlock multiplayer bonuses and skills. This version can be played either on or offline.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe multiplayer version also features improved cinematic techniques, boosters and the ability to upload great (or not-so-great) gameplay moments into social media platforms. A buddy system can be used for cooperative play in multiplayer mode, or you can go it alone during competitive play.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Uncharted 3\" is an outstanding adventure game", "4855": "Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung starting Wednesday and K-pop icon and actor Rain.\r\n\r\nAmong the highlights of the coverage has been South Korea", "4856": "a feminine but bold approach", "4857": "10 mSv increases an individual's cancer risk by 0.02 percent, he says.

Other medical centers may be doing even less to cut down on radiation during the test, says Andrew J. Einstein, M.D., Ph.D., of Columbia University Medical Center, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\r\n\r\n\"Probably the group of centers which were studied in this paper are more sophisticated and more aware of radiation-reduction methods than your typical center that is performing cardiac CT angiography,\" he says. According to Einstein, many other sites may not be using radiation-reduction techniques at all.\r\n\r\nWhen cardiac CT angiography is being used appropriately -- meaning, for example, in people with chest pain suggesting blocked heart arteries, rather than as a screening test for people with no symptoms of heart disease -- the benefits far outweigh the risk of the radiation, according to Einstein and Hausleiter.\r\n\r\nHowever, cardiac CT scans are often marketed directly to patients interested in finding out how much plaque they have in their arteries, even though there's no evidence to show that this is an appropriate way to use the test, Hausleiter says.

These are not the shouts of sibling rivalry or parental annoyance. This is the high-pitched, ear-shattering sound of a 13-year-old girl. More accurately, it is the sound of a frustrated, irritated, very loud teenager with autism.\r\n\r\nMarissa, the middle Bilson child, was diagnosed with autism when she was a toddler. Her mother, Mary, a nurse, knew something wasn't right early on, when young Marissa's tantrums were off the charts and seemingly unwarranted.\r\n\r\nBut during the first few years, doctors told Mary Bilson that her daughter was fine and this behavior would eventually pass. They were wrong on both counts.\r\n\r\nMarissa's behavior has not passed; it has, in fact, become worse. According to Bilson, Marissa and her tantrums rule the household. \"I don't want to hear her screaming and tantruming, so we pretty much let her do what she wants,\" Bilson says. \"We\" means Mary, her husband, John, and their two other children, Brittany, 15, and 6-year-old Brendan.\r\n\r\nKeeping the peace means that, when it comes to Marissa, the rules are different.

Watch part one of the Bilsons' journey \u00bb\r\n\r\nBut before you sit in judgment of the Bilsons, and suggest they just need a firm hand to keep their middle child in line, consider one thing: They are trying to cope with a child with severely impaired social sensibilities.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think people who don't have children with autism know how tough it is to deal with them?\" CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, asked Marissa's mom in a recent interview.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Mary Bilson replied. \"And I don't see how they could.\"\r\n\r\nShe's right -- we can't, because many of us have never seen autism in action, day in and day out.

Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons.\r\n\r\nHis attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is \"not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything.\"\r\n\r\nA woman identifying herself as Markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. Megan McAllister said Markoff \"is the wrong man\" and \"was set up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,\" McAllister wrote. \"All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!\"\r\n\r\nShe accused Boston police of \"trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the TV stations. What else is new??\"\r\n\r\nSuffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters, \"This was a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them.\"\r\n\r\nA procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, Conley said.\r\n\r\nA Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman \"put up a fight,\" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service.\r\n\r\nShe sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified.\r\n\r\nAuthorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.  Watch police say assailant has perused Craigslist ads \u00bb\r\n\r\nSurveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man.\r\n\r\nPolice traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and \"the case just begins to build from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,\" Conley said.\r\n\r\nThere may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. \"If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMarkoff is \"bearing up,\" according to attorney Salsberg.\r\n\r\n\"It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty,\" said Salsberg.\r\n\r\nMcAllister, in her e-mail to ABC, wrote, \"Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it.

Martin O'Malley's \"Smart, Green and Growing\" legislative package, aimed at reducing the state's greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020.\r\n\r\nThe pilot program will be evaluated at the end of two years, and officials will determine whether to send goats to other grazing projects on state highways, according to David Buck, a spokesman for the highway administration.\r\n\r\nThe goats are reducing the state's carbon footprint and protecting the area's bog turtles, listed as threatened. In addition, he said, the animals are much cheaper than a mowing program: State costs are about $10,000 for two years, most of that for delivery and veterinary services.\r\n\r\nBut the decision to utilize goats was not an easy one.
