{"0": "movie service on Tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies.\r\n\r\nThe move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their TV sets and heading straight to the Web -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows.\r\n\r\nThe service, named Fancast XFINITY TV (formerly called TV Everywhere), is the biggest cable industry initiative to keep people from skipping traditional TV service in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"I watch TV online every day. I find it more convenient than my regular TV...,\" Michael Heard, a self-employed computer repairman from Atlanta, Georgia, said via e-mail. \"I'm usually watching TV on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another.\r\n\r\n\"And also my time is important, so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. isn't convenient. Online TV allows me to watch what I want when I want.\"\r\n\r\nNetworks have tried for the past couple of years to find a way to reach Web-watching audiences by streaming content on their Web sites or making partnerships with Hulu, one of the larger online TV sites.\r\n\r\nNow, Comcast is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content. It is available to all Comcast customers, so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service.\r\n\r\nHeard said he doesn't expect to give up Hulu, though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast.\r\n\r\nHeard, trying out the site Tuesday after it went live, tweeted that he thought the service was \"awesome,\" and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of \"The Sopranos.\"\r\n\r\n\"The quality, it's really clear and loads fast,\" he said, though he noted there were still some bugs in the product.\r\n\r\nHeard occasionally had to reload the site, and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu.\r\n\r\nThe service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter, with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences.\r\n\r\nSome complained that high-definition videos, which are available on Hulu, are not available on Comcast's service. Others complained about having to download a separate video player, the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system, and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers.\r\n\r\nComcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future. In the next six months, after the service has gone through more beta testing, the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base.\r\n\r\nCustomers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to. Those not paying for HBO regularly, for example, won't be able to snag the newest episode of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" online.\r\n\r\nIn addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker, Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar. Executives said they hope the service would be available in about six months.\r\n\r\nTo access the content, users simply need to log in with their Comcast e-mail address at fancast.com.

According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year.\r\n\r\nMike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease.\r\n\r\n\"She really wanted to reach people all over the country,\" he said.\r\n\r\nGillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred \"Love Notes.\"\r\n\r\nAbby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,\" Aimee Love said. \"The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful.

So, like my friend Karen, I embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for Alzheimer's disease. Anything short of that is too risky.\r\n\r\nKaren is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective, widely available interventions. She compares Alzheimer's disease prevention to the polio vaccine: \"Had a vaccine not been developed for polio, hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe. Similarly, not only is treatment of Alzheimer's likely to be less effective than prevention, it's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive,\" she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine.\r\n\r\nKaren and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility: a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\nSo what's the holdup?

Watch how biochar is made and why it's important \u00bb\r\n\r\nBiochar is considered by many scientists to be the \"black gold\" for agriculture.\r\n\r\nIts high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground.\r\n\r\nBiochar helps clean the air two ways: by preventing rotting biomass from releasing harmful CO2 into the atmosphere, and by allowing plants to safely store CO2 they pull out of the air during photosynthesis.  See more about how biochar works \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere,\" said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar. \"It gives us a chance to produce carbon negative energy.\"\r\n\r\nWorldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen.\r\n\r\nGlobal carbon levels in the air have been steadily increasing at an alarming rate since the 1980s, according to NOAA. Since 2000, increases of 2 parts per million of CO2 have been common, according to NOAA.

Anyone who believes that he or she is having a heart attack should seek emergency medical attention.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes a heart attack is not painful, or the person experiencing it does not recognize the symptoms as heart-related, so he or she does not go to a hospital", "242": "Talk That Talk", "243": "lark", "244": "Zambia", "245": "at several other transit locations", "246": "airstrike were civilians who rushed the fuel trucks", "247": "Chris Brown", "248": "50", "249": "Warren Kole and Michael Ealy", "250": "67,100", "251": "second from the bottom of the German Bundesliga.\r\n\r\nMore than 600 Energie Cottbus supporters saw their team suffer its sixth loss in seven games when it received a 4-0 drubbing Friday at the hands of another team, Schalke.\r\n\r\nCottbus are second", "252": "President-elect Barack Obama", "253": "the White House", "254": "Italian", "255": "President Bush", "256": "Lance Battreal, Mark Booher and Charles Smith", "257": "Tom Hanks", "258": "by waves", "259": "LOS ANGELES", "260": "AT&T", "261": "Fabrizio Miccoli", "262": "releasing the information to help the government's fight against fraud", "263": "1868", "264": "inadequate", "265": "tackling a First Amendment case involving a movie about Hillary Clinton.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe justices heard arguments in a free-speech case over a 2008 documentary, shown in theaters, that was sharply critical of the onetime presidential candidate and current secretary of state.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt issue was whether the 90-minute \"Hillary: The Movie\" and television ads to promote it should have been subject to strict campaign finance laws on political advocacy or should have been seen as a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe high court's decision will determine whether politically charged documentaries can be regulated by the government in the same way as traditional campaign commercials", "266": "$5 million in hurricane relief.\r\n\r\nThe United States on Saturday \"informed the Cuban government that the U.S. government is committed to providing up to $5 million in relief assistance to Cuban hurricane victims", "267": "Containers no larger than 3 ounces are allowed in carry-on luggage", "268": "CNN's Sean Callebs", "269": "gathering and analyzing lots of data", "270": "Michelle Obama", "271": "three years", "272": "step aside", "273": "Vienna, Austria", "274": "Role of Economic Institutions\n\nStudents", "275": "CNN)", "276": "Leona Helmsley left her dog Trouble $12 million dollars in her will.\r\n\r\nWhat better time to look at some of the most bizarre codicils ever written?\r\n\r\n1.

When Liebenstein, a German countess, died in 1991, she left her entire $80-million estate to her dog, Gunther.\r\n\r\n3. Jeremy Bentham\r\n\r\nThe 18th-and-19th-century social philosopher left the world a rather odd bequest in his will: his preserved, clothed body.\r\n\r\nNo one's quite sure what Bentham was getting at with this \"gift,\" but since his 1832 death his clothed skeleton -- topped with a wax model of Bentham's head -- has been preserved in a wood-and-glass cabinet known as the Auto-Icon. It now resides at University College London and is occasionally moved so Bentham can \"attend\" meetings.\r\n\r\nBentham didn't want for the Auto-Icon to feature a wax head; he actually carried around the glass eyes he wanted used in his preserved face for years before his death. However, the preservation process distorted his face, so the wax replica had to stand in.\r\n\r\nFor many years Bentham's real head sat between his feet in the Auto-Icon, but it was such a target for pranksters that it eventually had to be locked away.

Luis Carlos de Noronha Cabral da Camara\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese aristocrat was a childless bachelor, so he divvied up his estate by picking 70 names at random from the Lisbon phone book in 1988. When he died 13 years later, his attorneys notified the unsuspecting beneficiaries that they stood to inherit their benefactor's cash, his home, and his car.\r\n\r\n6. Charles Millar\r\n\r\nThe Canadian attorney died a childless bachelor, but he left $568,106 to the mother who gave birth to the most children in Toronto in the 10 years following his 1928 death. This bequest prompted what Canadians called \"the Baby Derby\" as mothers raced to win the fortune. Finally, in 1938 four winners split the prize after giving birth to nine babies apiece.

Heinrich Heine\r\n\r\nThe German poet left his entire fortune to his wife, but with one catch: she had to remarry \"because then there will be at least one man to regret my death.\"\r\n\r\n8. S. Sanborn\r\n\r\nSanborn, a 19th-century New England hatter, left a rather macabre bequest to a friend -- a pair of drums made from Sanborn's skin. The friend received further instructions to go to Bunker Hill each June 17th and play \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" on the drums.\r\n\r\n9. T.M. Zink\r\n\r\nZink, an Iowa lawyer who died in 1930, must have had some pretty bad experiences with women. When he died he left his daughter a measly five bucks, and his wife got nothing.\r\n\r\nHe stipulated that the rest of his $100,000 estate be put in a trust for 75 years, then used to create the Zink Womanless Library. The library would have no feminine decorations, no books or magazine articles by female authors, and was required to have \"No Women Admitted\" carved into the stone over the entrance.\r\n\r\n10. Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\nWhen the celebrated author died, he left his friend Annie H. Ide his birthday. Ide had previously complained to Stevenson about the inconvenience of being born on Christmas, so the writer left her November 13th as a new birthday provided she take care of it with \"moderation and humanity... the said birthday not being so young as it once was.\"\r\n\r\n11. Henry Budd\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how he originally made 200,000 pounds, but when Henry Budd", "277": "more than 8,000 men and boys slaughtered in 1995 during the Bosnian war at Srebrenica in the worst massacre in Europe since World War II.\r\n\r\nThe killers -- Serbs seeking to drive out Bosnian Muslims in a policy of \"ethnic cleansing\" -- executed the region's fighting-age males, then used bulldozers to dump them into mass graves.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the work harder for the teams trying to put the bodies back together -- so they can be returned to their families for proper burial -- is that so many have been broken up over the years.\r\n\r\nMass graves were dug up and the bodies moved sometimes again and again, to hide evidence as the Serbs retreated amid the NATO bombing that followed Srebrenica and led to the end of the war. Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites, for instance.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave. Another man's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot, one of his legs was found near a grave, a hip was found inside the grave, his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave.\r\n\r\n\"What we do here is we sort them out,\" said Katzmarzyk, the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons.\r\n\r\nKatzmarzyk's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker, simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together.  Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP's work \u00bb\r\n\r\nThen, a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives.\r\n\r\nBut DNA can only go so far, and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk's table are those of a man and his 22-year-old son, it cannot say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21-year-old or his 24-year-old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point.\r\n\r\nIt's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related. Across the room, brothers lie next to each other, but as yet the scientists do not know who is who.\r\n\r\nSo Katzmarzyk and her colleagues are also experts in forensic anthropology, using other pointers to make an identification.\r\n\r\nThey will look for clues to the age of the remains and any other factors that could identify them: Did the man break his leg as a child? What clothes was he wearing? How tall was he?\r\n\r\n\"We started to look at clothing, place of disappearance,\" said Katzmarzyk.\r\n\r\n\"We use all kinds of evidence to identify as many people as possible.\"  Watch a Bosnia concentration camp survivor describe the torture and rape she witnessed \u00bb\r\n\r\nAbout 5,200", "278": "British identification documents", "279": "Grand Slam", "280": "John Kiriakou", "281": "debris", "282": "Mike", "283": "Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically", "284": "Mumbai, India's, Garib Nagar, or city of the poor.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, even the roof over the real-life slum dweller's head was taken away as Indian authorities tore down the shanty where Ismail's family lived.\r\n\r\nAuthorities said the home and about 20 others around it were illegally built.\r\n\r\nSenior Inspector Rahim Sheikh told CNN that the shanties were brought down as part of a municipal drive to clear encroachments on public land.

Or rather, it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units, as they don't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful: nutrient-rich compost.\r\n\r\nEarthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly, in this context: The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus, which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting, according to CityFarmer.org. Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day, but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process, according to The Ecologist.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of them, too. You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land, according to NatureWatch, their population doubling in size every one-two months. And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves, stems and dead roots in one year, ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process.\r\n\r\nWhat they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients. According to NatureWatch, earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen, seven times as much phosphorous, 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more \"beneficial bacteria\" than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place. Literally speaking, what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out.\r\n\r\nUtilizing 'black gold'\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise why these worms' byproducts are often referred to as \"black gold,\" this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world's agricultural soil has become \"seriously degraded,\" according to the UK Soil Association.\r\n\r\nWorm compost:\r\n\r\nJust one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days, according to ScienceDaily.

And already in the United States you can see the first signs of an important transformation here as Americans save more and as we borrow substantially less from the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we all recognize that we need to act before the memory of the crisis fades and before the impetus for reform recedes,\" he said. \"And we're trying to bring greater urgency and commitment to the need to act together.\"\r\n\r\nThe tightening of global financial regulations was expected to top the summit's agenda and comes as some major economies are beginning to recover.

Well, here you go:\r\r\n\r\r\nA few days ago, Facebook allegedly kicked famous author Salman Rushdie off of its social network, and then asked him to change his posted name to Ahmed if he wanted to return.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie -- known for his outspokenness -- went on a rant about the incident on Twitter, where he has more than 100,000 followers. Facebook eventually \"buckled,\" he wrote Monday.\r\r\n\r\r\nHere's a play-by-play of what happened, according to Rushdie's Twitter feed, which I condensed:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Amazing. 2 days ago FB deactivated my page saying they didn't believe I was me. I had to send a photo of my passport page,\" he wrote. \"Then they said yes, I was me, but insisted I use the name Ahmed which appears before Salman on my passport and which I have never used.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Now they have reactivated my FB page as 'Ahmed Rushdie,' in spite of the world knowing me as Salman. Morons. @MarkZuckerbergF? Are you listening?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFacebook did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the incident.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Tuesday, his Facebook page, with \"Salman\" as his first name, appeared to have been reactivated by the social network.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie rose to international notoriety in the 1980s after his novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" stirred protests throughout the Muslim world. The Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran issued a fatwa against Rushdie because of the book.\r\r\n\r\r\nHis recent tussle raises issues with Facebook's policy of requiring people to use their real names when registering with the social network. People who don't use their real names are found to be out of compliance with Facebook's rules and can have their accounts deactivated.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way,\" Facebook's terms of service document says.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie's situation shows how difficult it can be for people to prove who they are. He submitted his passport to Facebook, he wrote, and still had problems.\r\r\n\r\r\nSupporters of democratic protests in the Middle East and elsewhere have criticized Facebook and other social networks like Google+ for their real-name policies, saying they prevent people from organizing against authoritarian governments that could use a network like Facebook to crack down.\r\r\n\r\r\nIf they could use pseudonyms, they would be safer, some say.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There are myriad reasons why individuals may wish to use a name other than the one they were born with,\" Jillian York wrote on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's blog in July. \"They may be concerned about threats to their lives or livelihoods, or they may risk political or economic retribution. They may wish to prevent discrimination or they may use a name that's easier to pronounce or spell in a given culture.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFacebook always has maintained its position as an \"identity network.\" A core philosophy of the site is that people should be themselves -- and should be accountable for their posts with their real names.\r\r\n\r\r\nRushdie's case shows how tricky enforcement can be, though.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This is the sort of thing that makes you wonder what real names policy is all about,\" Alexis Madrigal wrote on The Atlantic's website. He added: \"Seriously, what is the point of forcing Salman Rushdie to go by Ahmed Rushdie?

It now resides at University College London and is occasionally moved so Bentham can \"attend\" meetings.\r\n\r\nBentham didn't want for the Auto-Icon to feature a wax head; he actually carried around the glass eyes he wanted used in his preserved face for years before his death. However, the preservation process distorted his face, so the wax replica had to stand in.\r\n\r\nFor many years Bentham's real head sat between his feet in the Auto-Icon, but it was such a target for pranksters that it eventually had to be locked away.

At the time, Anderson was working as a postdoctoral fellow in the hospital's human biochemistry lab.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnderson is charged with capital murder in the Friday shooting deaths, making her eligible for the death penalty in Alabama. Authorities said she was attending a faculty meeting in a university building when she brandished a gun and shot six colleagues, killing three.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe mother of four was arrested as she was leaving the building, Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes said Saturday. A 9 mm handgun was recovered from the second floor of the building after the shootings Friday.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Saturday, it was revealed that in 1986, Anderson, then 19, shot her brother to death in Braintree, Massachusetts. Authorities determined after an investigation that the shooting was accidental.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Braintree Police Chief Paul Frazier said Saturday, \"It is a far different story, I believe, than what was reported back then. I cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAnderson's husband, Jim, told CNN on Monday that federal investigators had gathered a dozen subjects in the attempted bombing, but \"there were never any suspects. Never anyone charged, never anyone arrested.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Then five years later, we got a letter from the ATF saying, 'You are in the clear,' \" he said, referring to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\r\r\n\r\r\nSylvia Fluckiger, a lab technician who worked with Anderson at the time, told The Boston Globe on Sunday that Anderson had a dispute with Rosenberg shortly before the bomb incident.\r\r\n\r\r\nFluckiger told CNN affiliate WCVB-TV in Boston, \"Police interviewed her, and she told me about it. I really wondered if she may have had, you know, some more knowledge, although I'm not accusing her of anything.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nRosenberg was opening a package delivered to his home while he was away on vacation, but he saw wires and a cylinder inside and called police, the Globe reported.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"She was the suspect early on,\" the law enforcement official, who the Globe said had knowledge of the case, told the newspaper of Anderson. She allegedly was concerned that she was going to receive a negative evaluation from Rosenberg, the official said.\r\r\n\r\r\nJim Anderson told The New York Times the December 1986 death of his wife's brother, Seth, was accidental. He declined to comment when CNN asked him about the shooting Monday.\r\r\n\r\r\nFrazier, however, said Saturday that an official involved in the case and still working for Braintree police told him that the teen had shot her brother during an argument. She fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone, then argued with her brother and shot him, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe fled the home after the shooting and was arrested after pointing a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an unsuccessful attempt to get the driver to stop. During the booking process, then-Chief John Polio called and told the officers to release her, Frazier said. He added her mother was then a member of the Braintree Personnel Board.\r\r\n\r\r\nReached by CNN, Polio, now 87 and retired, denied calling in that order, saying detectives told him the shooting appeared accidental and it was determined Anderson should be released to her mother. He said any link between Anderson's release and her mother's position on the board was \"laughable.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAnderson's mother, Judith, did not answer her door Monday. Reached by telephone, she told CNN, \"We're very distraught,\" and declined further comment.\r\r\n\r\r\nA December 8, 1986, article in The Boston Globe said Anderson asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12-gauge shotgun and accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon. The article cited Polio as the source.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe state police report on the incident, released Sunday by the office of Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Massachusetts, is similar to the Globe's account. Delahunt was district attorney at the time; staffers said he was in the Middle East on Sunday and unable to comment on the case.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe 1986 report said Braintree police told state police investigators \"indications were that Amy Bishop had been attempting to manipulate the shotgun and had subsequently brought the gun downstairs in an attempt to gain assistance from her mother in disarming the weapon\" when it went off, shooting her brother in the chest.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn a December 17, 1986, interview, Anderson told authorities she \"thought it would be a good idea if she learned how to load the shotgun in the house,\" according to the state police report. The young woman told police she was concerned for her own safety after the family home was broken into, although she previously had been afraid of the gun.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe said she got the gun and loaded shells into it, but was unable to get them out. Anderson said that while she was attempting to unload the weapon on her bed, it went off. She then took it downstairs to ask for help in unloading it, where the shooting occurred.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe police report said both Anderson and her mother said the shooting was accidental. Her mother told police she did not hear the earlier shot in her daughter's bedroom and \"believed the house was relatively well soundproofed and that such a discharge would not necessarily be heard on another floor of the house.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nFrazier said police records of the incident are missing. But Polio said, \"There was no cover-up. Absolutely no cover-up and no missing records. The records were all there when I left. Where they went in the last 22 years and two police chiefs subsequent, I don't know.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBraintree Mayor Joseph Sullivan said Sunday that a review will commence to locate all materials associated with the shooting.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnderson, who is known to students as Dr. Bishop, had been working at the University of Alabama in Huntsville since 2003 and was up for tenure, according to spokesman Ray Garner. However, authorities wouldn't discuss possible motives or whether the issue of tenure may have played a role in the shooting.\r\r\n\r\r\nGarner said the university gives teachers six years to get tenure.

He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel.\r\r\n\r\r\nYet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.\r\r\n\r\r\nI made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.\r\r\n\r\r\nHow?\r\r\n\r\r\nNow we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels -- and staggering government deficits. The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts.\r\r\n\r\r\nZapatero slunk out of town a little while ago. Good riddance to the man who boorishly insulted the American flag at the Spanish National Day parade in 2003 to score a point with the left wing of his political party.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain's conservatives", "1406": "Indonesia", "1407": "Lou Gehrig's Disease", "1408": "Gullberg", "1409": "reform", "1410": "New media and talk radio", "1411": "3 to 10", "1412": "crushing personal debts", "1413": "mail bombing", "1414": "windows", "1415": "the sale", "1416": "free-trade rules", "1417": "their peace is being disrupted", "1418": "10", "1419": "Moe", "1420": "Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe", "1421": "Misty Cummings", "1422": "Cholera's short incubation period of two hours to five days", "1423": "February 9", "1424": "Feusahrens", "1425": "23 percent of the pandas' habitat in the study area was destroyed", "1426": "June 5", "1427": "more than 1,000", "1428": "SCIRI", "1429": "May 31, 1859", "1430": "double", "1431": "36", "1432": "foreign nationals", "1433": "snakes and insects", "1434": "Saturday", "1435": "around 11 p.m.", "1436": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner", "1437": "she had been a victim of \"character assassination", "1438": "GOP", "1439": "lost a family member on Thursday", "1440": "Sarah Palin", "1441": "The plane", "1442": "Jason Moran and his associate Pasquale Barboro", "1443": "$400 million", "1444": "Cairo's Tahrir Square to demand speedy change.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe president they ousted, Hosni Mubarak, faces a possible death sentence if he survives a variety of ailments that have left him hospital-bound since April.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe tourists who once flocked to the pyramids of Giza and the beaches of the Red Sea have yet to return, and the joblessness and poverty that fueled the protests is deeper than before.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe result is a revolution that remains incomplete, with the coalition that formed in Tahrir Square splintering over different visions of a post-Mubarak future. But few dispute that the uprising launched on January 25 has changed an ancient nation in a fundamental way.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I am optimistic about the future. We can't go back,\" said Lillian Wagdy, a photographer who was taking part in the protests. \"The wall of fear has fallen, and the people will now demand their rights and stay on the streets.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics, said Egyptians have undergone a \"psychological rapture\" since the revolution.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The psychology of the citizen has changed,\" he said. \"Millions of voiceless people have regained their voices ... It's changed the relationship between sons and fathers and fathers and daughters.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe protests lasted 18 days, growing despite clashes with police and pro-Mubarak gangs. The armed forces refused to intercede on Mubarak's behalf, and he handed over power to a council of generals on February 11.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe generals suspended Egypt's constitution and named a civilian caretaker government, but remain the final authority in Cairo. That's one of the things that rankles the protesters who have made camp in Tahrir Square since a fresh round of protests in June.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"For me to leave Tahrir, the ruling generals need to listen to our demands and take action to ensure them,\" said Mustafa Sadek, a 16-year-old high-school student taking part in the protests last week. \"We also want a clear schedule, a path to elections and reform. We want a plan that lays out the future.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nRajia Omran, a lawyer and human rights activist, said the revolution \"isn't going too bad.\" But she said patience will be needed for months or even years to come.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It will take 5 to 10 years to evaluate the revolution,\" said Omran, whose group helped organize the first protests. \"Nobody can evaluate it now. Any evaluation now is premature.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nWith liberals, nationalists, leftists and Islamists now split over whether elections or constitutional reforms should come first, Gerges said the protesters are realizing an old lesson: \"Revolutions are messy.\" But those debates are \"a healthy sign that civil society is still alive.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My worry is the cleavages are much deeper than we think, and the question is, will there be a government that will be able to govern in the next two or three years?\" Gerges said. \"If you don't have a consensus on what the future is, you won't be able to govern.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nJumana Shehata, a former media consultant at the National Council for Human Rights, has been critical of the path the revolution has taken. She said secular political parties need more time to organize as a counterweight to the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Right now, the Muslim Brotherhood is the only strong party, and we need more diversity,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Gerges said the Brotherhood has its own divisions, with younger members \"closer to the nationalists and the liberals and the leftists than the old guard.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe military's decision recent decision to delay parliamentary elections until November is a concession to the secular groups, said Shadi Hamid, an analyst at the Qatar-based branch of the Brookings Institution. Hamid said that vote \"will clarify matters,\" demonstrating which of the competing factions \"have the support and capability to push things forward and challenge the military's hold on power.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nShehata took part in the January protests at Tahrir Square and said most Egyptians still support the revolution, but are \"fed up\" with the new demonstrations.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I understand the chaos after a revolution, but I don't see the people in Tahrir now as revolutionaries,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd Hamid called the renewed protests a \"frightening turn\" in post-revolutionary Egypt.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"More and more, the military staff is being portrayed as an enemy of democracy and an enemy of the transition, at least among the people in Tahrir Square,\" Hamid said. Neither side appears willing to back down, \"and it increasingly looks like the interests of both sides are in some ways impossible to reconcile.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEgypt's military has been the backbone of the state since 1952, when Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser led a coup that toppled the country's monarchy -- and the generals will likely try to keep much of that influence in any new government, said Nathan Brown, a Middle East analyst at George Washington University.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There's no question the military does not want to be responsible for collecting the trash and running the schools and the health-care system and the economy, which is a mess,\" Brown told CNN. \"They don't want civilian oversight when they do go back to the barracks, and they don't want to lose a privileged position in Egyptian political and social life.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut that sort of privilege may be harder to come by in the new Egypt. During the March referendum on changes to the country's constitution, Brown said, newspapers carried stories about VIPs who showed up at polling places where long lines had formed, expecting to be allowed to vote ahead of the hoi polloi.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Every time this happened, they were told, 'Wait a minute, this is a different country now.

\u00bb\r\n\r\nCNN: When did you come out?\r\n\r\nBatt: My real Broadway break was in \"Starlight Express.\" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues.\r\n\r\nThank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, \"No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal.\r\n\r\nJust this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization.\r\n\r\nI only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in \"Jeffrey,\" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family.\r\n\r\nMy partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society.\r\n\r\nCNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today?\r\n\r\nBatt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast.\r\n\r\nThere are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job.\r\n\r\nCNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in \"Mad Men", "1651": "140 mph", "1652": "Jason Moran and his associate Pasquale Barboro", "1653": "CNN", "1654": "Todd Palin", "1655": "Sunday's plane crash in Phuket continued to arrive in the Thai resort town on Tuesday", "1656": "$333.25 to make, iSuppli says", "1657": "Obama needs to be wary of alienating teachers who can be his allies on education reform", "1658": "King fought and died", "1659": "CNN", "1660": "a vital step", "1661": "hasn't really represented all of New Yorkers.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The fact is there are thousands and thousands of us out on the streets, and he's not really recognizing that we're a movement,\" Combelic told CNN on Saturday. \"We should be heard by New York politicians.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Saturday, New York protesters set up a second base at Washington Square Park. The park in Greenwich Village is about two miles north of Zuccotti Park, a private park that's been considered the main rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in the city.\r\r\n\r\r\nA rally was held in Washington Square, followed by a now-customary people's assembly to discuss the movement and an art show Saturday evening.

Americans against Americans.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Saturday, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel backed the demonstrators -- whom he has been visiting regularly over the past three weeks -- for venting their frustrations and exercising their constitutional rights.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Their dreams are being shattered,\" Rangel told CNN's Don Lemon. \"They may be an inconvenience to a whole lot of people in that area, but people are going to sleep at night with an economic nightmare.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe New York Democrat urged \"more spiritual leaders\" to join a movement he claimed championed the poor and disadvantaged, saying \"there's no moral reason why they have to wait for something to catch on.\" He also dismissed criticism that the demonstrators don't have a coherent purpose, saying despite their varied issues and lack of organization, their sentiments are raw and real.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They don't have to know what the solution is,\" he said. \"There's one thing they know is (there's) something wrong when so many people are out of work, and we find the disparity with the very rich. ... Something is wrong.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nCombelic, the New York spokesman, said the movement chiefly is trying to showcase \"active democracy and (show that) everyone has a voice in government.\" He said the protests -- which have been associated with progressive causes -- are \"a rebuke of government, that includes the left and the right.\"", "1662": "a mark of respect", "1663": "cultural genocide", "1664": "Talk Asia", "1665": "Malaysia and Brunei", "1666": "Maseth", "1667": "George Hamilton's mother", "1668": "Oxford Street in London", "1669": "spent fuel cooling pools of another nuclear power plant", "1670": "19.8 percent", "1671": "legal experts", "1672": "delaying", "1673": "CNN.com Podcast", "1674": "the kids", "1675": "Old Tappan", "1676": "unmarried with no children of his own and had until recently been a marine biologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\r\n\r\nThe Times said that shortly before his death he had left his academic job to set up a pottery workshop at home.\r\n\r\nFrieda Hughes, a poet, author and artist, said in a statement to the newspaper: \"It is with profound sorrow that I must announce the death of my brother, Nicholas Hughes, who died by his own hand on Monday March 16, 2009 at his home in Alaska.\r\n\r\n\"He had been battling depression for some time.\"\r\n\r\nShe added: \"His lifelong fascination with fish and fishing was a strong and shared bond with our father (many of whose poems were about the natural world).\r\n\r\n\"He was a loving brother, a loyal friend to those who knew him and, despite the vagaries that life threw at him, he maintained an almost childlike innocence and enthusiasm for the next project or plan.\"\r\n\r\nHughes was only a baby when his mother killed herself, and his father tried to shield his children from the intense public interest in the family. Some feminist groups blamed the death on Ted Hughes, who had left Plath for Assia Wevill, the wife of another poet.\r\n\r\nSix years later, Wevill gassed herself and their daughter Shura in an apparent copycat suicide. Ted Hughes died in 1998, the year he published Birthday Letters, a series of poems about his life with Plath and her death.\r\n\r\nHughes appears in both of his parents' poetry. In \"Nick and the Candlestick,\" published in Plath's posthumous collection \"Ariel,\" she wrote: \"You are the one. Solid the spaces lean on, envious. You are the baby in the barn.\"\r\n\r\nLater his father wrote of how, after Plath's death, their son's eyes \"became wet jewels, the hardest substance of the purest pain.

The 9-year-olds probably do, right?\r\n\r\nKate Gosselin: They understand the process. They're working through it, the same that Jon and I are. They're doing remarkably well. This has opened up a lot of discussions between them and myself. A lot of questions come my way, and we're dealing with it. They're doing very well considering.  Watch Gosselin discuss the split \u00bb\r\n\r\nKing: Why did you agree to do this reality show in the first place?\r\n\r\nGosselin: In the very beginning, we started filming a one-hour special. It was a way to document what was happening in our lives. At that time, there was a lot of local news stories. There were a lot of people in the country and the world, believe it or not, pulling for us. As you know, sextuplets are not born every day, so there was a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nWe did the one-hour special to show everyone. I always pictured like the little old lady that was sitting at home who was praying for us, rooting for us and needing to know what happened to those babies that were born. So we did it for that reason as well as to collect the memories for ourselves.\r\n\r\nKing: Why did you agree to do a regular reality show? You could have said that's the special, here's my life, goodbye.\r\n\r\nGosselin: I could have. At that point, the one-hour special was a very good experience. The network, TLC, we were on Discovery Health at that time. Now, TLC is wonderful, supportive, and it was a great experience for us. So we, you know, really moved forward because of that reason. It was healthy and safe and fun.\r\n\r\nKing: Do the kids talk to you about divorce?\r\n\r\nGosselin: They do. And as any child, you know, when their parents are divorcing, the goal is peace and we've achieved that numerous times. The Fourth of July we spent together as a family. My goal is, no matter what the circumstance, no matter what place, you know, one of us is in, my goal is really peace and the best that it can be for the kids.\r\n\r\nKing: Do they get counseling?\r\n\r\nGosselin: We have not started that process, but I feel like it is a very normal thing to do. And absolutely, when the time is right.\r\n\r\nKing: Jon is quoted in the new \"Us Weekly\": \"I wish I had a 9 to 5 job instead of the nightmare I'm living. This is 24/7. I don't even want to do taping the show anymore.\" What's your reaction to that?\r\n\r\nGosselin: Jon's opinions and his goals are his. I know that, personally, for myself and the kids, this has been a good experience. It continues to be a good experience. And, you know, really the network has been extremely supportive, above and beyond, I feel, what they need to be. And I only experience good things.\r\n\r\nEveryone works. Everyone has a job. Everyone has what they're dealing with. And, generally speaking, this is the most flexible, workable, wonderful job for myself.\r\n\r\nKing: How long have you been doing it now?\r\n\r\nGosselin: We are in season 5. We started filming in August of 2005.\r\n\r\nKing: Why is it such a good thing to have a private life public?\r\n\r\nGosselin: It's been a source of huge -- for whatever reason -- inspiration for a lot of people. Many, many people -- many parents feel that their decisions are, maybe not, great decisions. Every parent has that, you know, parent guilt of my goal is to produce wonderful, productive individuals and put them out into society. That is the goal of a parent -- for us to show the world that we are not perfect, life is unpredictable, but life always goes on and there's always, always, always something to look forward to. And for me, that is raising my children to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nKing: But as an intelligent person, you also know to all good things, there are downsides.\r\n\r\nGosselin: Absolutely. With every positive, there is a negative across the board in life. It's about choosing to see the positive and working with the negative.\r\n\r\nKing: So what happens now? Are you and the kids going to do the show and Jon is out?\r\n\r\nGosselin: I'm not the person to make that decision. I know that myself and the kids will continue the show.\r\n\r\nKing: But if Jon says I don't want to do it anymore, I don't want to be part of it, I'm divorced, I don't need this, will the network say it's you and the kids?\r\n\r\nGosselin: That would be a question for the network.\r\n\r\nKing: Will the name of the show change?\r\n\r\nGosselin: That would be a question for the network.\r\n\r\nKing: And if they said forget it, that would be OK with you? If they said we'll continue, that's OK with you?\r\n\r\nGosselin: That will be their decision.\r\n\r\nKing: You've become famous worldwide over this. What's the downside of that?\r\n\r\nGosselin: You know, I could really live without the following.\r\n\r\nKing: Attention", "1942": "he said of the illegal trade, adding that countries with volatile governments tend to be most at risk.\r\r\n\r\r\nPaul Bennett is head of British mission \"The Society for Libyan Studies,\" which promotes and co-ordinates the activities of scholars working on the archaeology, history, linguistics and natural history of Libya.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It is certain that there are organized bands of antiquities thieves going across the border into Egypt,\" he said, citing reports of grave robbing in sites in Libya.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The problem is on the border [with Egypt], it's become very porous.

General Assembly, where Obama called for international unity in attacking the world's challenges.\r\r\n\r\r\nAsked if he was expressing disappointment in the U.S. president, Ahmadinejad responded, \"We simply didn't expect him to say something that was ... was baseless.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEarlier Friday evening Obama said \"Iran is on notice\" regarding its nuclear efforts, and that the international community is united in its opposition to Tehran's nuclear program.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They are going to have to make a choice: Are they willing to go down the path to greater prosperity and security for Iran, giving up the acquisition of nuclear weapons ... or will they continue down a path that is going to lead to confrontation,\" he said at a news conference at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama's comments came hours after Iran acknowledged the existence of a second uranium enrichment facility and ahead of next week's planned meeting between Iran and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members, plus Germany. The October 1 meeting will take place in Geneva, Switzerland.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama said he would not speculate on any course of action absent a satisfactory response from Iran.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Even countries who a year ago or six months ago might have been reluctant to even discuss things like sanctions,\" are starting to become concerned, Obama said.\r\r\n\r\r\nObama said his \"preferred course of action is to resolve this in a diplomatic fashion. It's up to the Iranians to respond.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe U.S. president said the conclusions about Iran's nuclear ambitions came as a result of the work of three intelligence agencies -- those of Britain, France and the United States. The work, Obama said, was done \"to make sure that we were absolutely confident about the situation there.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe United States has known about the unfinished site since the Bush administration, according to senior U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations. French intelligence officials were also aware of the facility for several months at least, a U.S. diplomatic source said.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt wasn't until Monday that Iran wrote a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency, revealing the existence of the underground facility on a military base near the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe facility is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges, which is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor but is sufficient to manufacture bomb-making material, according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter.\r\r\n\r\r\nIran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site, an agency spokesman said.\r\r\n\r\r\nOnce Iran alerted the IAEA, Obama began sharing U.S. intelligence on the nuclear site with allies, particularly with Russia and China in an effort to get those countries on board with new sanctions against Iran, the officials said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Friday that Iran admitted the existence of the \"new pilot fuel enrichment plant,\" prompting Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to respond at the G-20 economic summit.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the nonproliferation regime,\" Obama said, with Brown and Sarkozy standing at his side.

They tried an old trick, turning the cable box power switch on and off, hoping the episode would eventually appear. Finally, something did show up -- but not the finale.\r\n\r\nIn the place where the show should have been, Wallen, 24, and his friends found a one-minute preview of the finale that ended simply with a title screen bearing the date \"March 10,\" the day the show will be available on demand.\r\n\r\nLike thousands of other \"Wire\" fanatics who had similarly flocked to the presumed early screener Sunday night, the group sat stunned.\r\n\r\n\"It completely killed the whole weekend,\" Wallen said. \"We are diehard fans who have watched it every week -- a week early. We didn't think this week would be any different.\"\r\n\r\nThe finale of \"The Wire\" has earned intense interest from fans who have followed the Baltimore-set show zealously since its premiere in 2002. The critically lauded show has never matched the audience of other HBO programs, such as \"The Sopranos,\" but its viewers are a particularly passionate lot, following the show's motley crew of cops, drug dealers, struggling children, politicians and journalists with deeply probing blogs and running commentary.

And a real-life Malibu Dream House, a temporary home tricked out for Barbie's birthday -- including a chandelier made of her hair -- is currently on display in California.\r\r\n\r\r\nNot bad for a doll that, according to author Robin Gerber, was initially inspired by \"a sexually-themed gag toy for men.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe now-legendary doll was conceived by Ruth Handler, a daughter of Polish immigrants, said Gerber, author of the newly published \"Barbie and Ruth: The Story of the World's Most Famous Doll and the Woman Who Created Her.\" She and her husband, Elliott, owned Mattel until a scandal involving accusations of cooked books drove them out in 1975, Gerber said.\r\r\n\r\r\nHandler, who died in 2002, used to watch her own daughter, Barbara, play with paper dolls. Then, on a trip to Europe, Barbara became fascinated with a buxom doll that Gerber said was based on a female German cartoon character, named Lilli, who used sex to get what she wanted.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"My guess is she didn't know what it was when she bought it,\" because at that point, four years after the Lilli doll's release, it had landed in European toy stores, the author explained. Handler took the doll back to the states and insisted Mattel designers get to work.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Who would have thought,\" Gerber said. Barbie was thought up by a woman and modeled on a cartoon character \"who was essentially a prostitute.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThough the men at Mattel, a company that had never sold dolls before, were skeptical at best, Handler proved to be \"a corporate genius,\" Gerber said. In the three years after Barbie's release, Mattel's worth grew to $200 million, doubling the value earned in the first 20 years of business.\r\r\n\r\r\nHandler's daughter, now Barbara Segal, 67, is a bit dumbfounded by all the hype.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's been quite an interesting ride,\" she said from her Los Angeles, California, area home. \"I can't believe this doll's created all of this.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBarbie's collector line (not what's seen on Wal-Mart shelves) is designed for the grown-ups who still relish Barbie.

I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi.\r\n\r\nI trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.\r\n\r\nBy mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way.\r\n\r\nFinally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel. It was time to regroup and figure this out.\r\n\r\nThis was not the worse thing that has ever happened to me. I have survived worse situations.  Watch Gilbert Tuhabonye talk about his experiences \u00bb.\r\n\r\nI started to reflect upon the fact that every time I try and train hard for a marathon, something happens. Perhaps this is just not the right time for me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps God has something else in mind for me. I am being stubborn and pushing for something that is not supposed to be right now.\r\n\r\nNow, I am home in Austin, Texas some weeks later.

Banks, labor unions, corporations, legal systems, and not-for-profit organizations are examples of important institutions. A different kind of institution, clearly defined and enforced property rights, is essential to a market economy.\n\nStandard 16 : Role of Government\n\nStudents will understand that: There is an economic role for government in a market economy whenever the benefits of a government policy outweigh its costs. Governments often provide for national defense, address environmental concerns, define and protect property rights, and attempt to make markets more competitive. Most government policies also redistribute income.\n\nThe Economics America National Standards (http://www.ncee.net/ea/standards/) are published by the National Council on Economic Education (http://www.ncee.net/).\n\nSocial Studies\n\nStandard V. Individuals, Groups and Institutions: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of interactions among individuals, groups, and institutions.\n\nStandard VI. Power, Authority, and Governance: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of how people create and change structures of power, authority, and governance.\n\nThe Curriculum Standards for Social Studies (http://www.socialstudies.org/standards/strands/) are published by the National Council for Social Studies (http://ncss.org/).\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nSuggested Activity\n\nPoint out to students that one of the best ways for them to prepare for homeownership is to arm themselves with knowledge, and that the purpose of this activity is to help them obtain this information.\n\nGroup students and instruct each group to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the top ten things that first-time homebuyers should know before they shop for a mortgage.

He doesn't support more traditional use of coal, either,\" McCain said.\n\n\"So what does Sen. Obama support in energy policy? Well, for starters, he supported the energy bill of 2005 -- a grab bag of corporate favors that I opposed. And now he supports new taxes on energy producers. He wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas. If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea too -- and a lot of good it did us.\"\n\nMcCain argues that a windfall profits tax will only increase the country's dependence on foreign oil and be an obstacle to domestic exploration.\n\n\"I'm all for recycling -- but it's better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s,\" he said.\n\nObama on Tuesday blasted McCain for changing his stance on offshore drilling.\n\n\"John McCain's support of the moratorium on offshore drilling during his first presidential campaign was certainly laudable, but his decision to completely change his position and tell a group of Houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear today was the same Washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades,\" he said.\n\n\"It's another example of short-term political posturing from Washington, not the long-term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also criticized McCain's plan, saying it would ruin his state's tourism industry and would not solve the problem.\n\n\"I thought John McCain was serious when he said he wanted to make America less dependent on oil. I didn't think he was a flip-flopper. He knows that more drilling isn't the solution to high gas prices,\" Nelson said Tuesday.\n\nObama said a windfall profits tax would ease the burden of energy costs on working families. He also wants to invest in affordable, renewable energy sources.\n\nControversy over offshore drilling surfaced in the United States in 1969, after a crack in the seafloor led to a huge oil spill off Santa Barbara, California.\n\nDuring the 1970s, when many Arab nations launched an oil embargo, many", "2685": "veracity of the Holocaust", "2686": "would have liked to play Major League baseball", "2687": "Mustafa Tamimi", "2688": "Jose Mourinho extended his remarkable unbeaten run in home league matches to 130 as his Italian champions Inter Milan", "2689": "chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee's Voting Rights Institute", "2690": "Good Morning America", "2691": "two car bombs", "2692": "Mark Morgan", "2693": "language issues, repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others", "2694": "CNN", "2695": "a prostitute's services and were caught by police", "2696": "Fabian Cancellara", "2697": "Petters Group Worldwide", "2698": "Nine people were killed and 19", "2699": "Robert Gates", "2700": "Roland Martin", "2701": "less than 120 seconds", "2702": "yo-yo", "2703": "our vision of what the future will look", "2704": "Capt.

Lack of funding can be just as serious, as the case of the California state parks demonstrates.\r\n\r\nThe sites are listed in alphabetical order:\r\n\r\nBoyd Theater, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Art Deco movie palace known as the Sameric was closed in 2002 and is for sale. A local group, Friends of the Boyd, is trying to save the 1928 theater, the last of its kind in Philadelphia. Only a few elaborate theaters from that era have survived, and the Boyd was the only one built in the downtown area. Moe said a \"sympathetic developer\" could restore the theater.\r\n\r\nCalifornia's park system The largest state park system in the United States suffers from chronic underfunding, including $1.2 billion worth of deferred maintenance, the National Trust said. The problem is worsening because of California's budget crisis. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger submitted a budget proposal this year that would have closed 48 parks, but the National Trust said the revised budget restored $11.8 million of the $13.3 million in cuts he requested.\r\n\r\nCurrent funds cover only 40 percent of maintenance and operations, which means irreplaceable historic and cultural resources remain endangered, the National Trust said. The system includes 278 parks, 1.5 million acres and 295 miles of ocean front. Many parks house historic buildings such as the 1820s-era Franciscan La Purisima Mission complex near Lompoc.\r\n\r\nCharity Hospital and adjacent neighborhood, New Orleans, Louisiana Charity Hospital, once the main trauma center for southeastern Louisiana, was closed after Hurricane Katrina swamped New Orleans in 2005. The building was declared unsalvageable, according to Donald R. Smithburg, chief executive of Louisiana State University Health Care Services Division, which operates university hospitals. There are plans to demolish nearly 200 homes in the Mid-City neighborhood to accommodate construction of two new hospitals. Alternate locations for the new hospitals are available, and Charity Hospital could be rehabilitated, according to the National Trust.\r\n\r\nGreat Falls Portage, Great Falls, Montana This National Historic Landmark is one of the best-preserved landscapes along the Lewis and Clark Trail, but a massive coal-fired power plant is planned in the area. \"Development abutting the Great Falls Portage, an undeveloped rural area under panoramic blue Montana skies, will irreparably harm the cultural and visual landscape,\" the National Trust said\r\n\r\nHangar One, Moffett Field, Santa Clara County, California The hangar was built in 1932 to house U.S. Navy dirigibles. It is a cavernous, 200-foot-tall, dome-shaped structure sitting on more than 8 acres. A 2003 inspection revealed carcinogenic PCBs leaking from the hangar's metallic exterior, the National Trust said. PCBs were widely used in electrical transformers. The Navy transferred Hangar One to NASA in 1992. Although the Navy remains responsible for environmental remediation, it is not required to preserve the building.\r\n\r\nLower East Side, New York The Lower East Side in southeast Manhattan was home for immigrants and the working class in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is becoming gentrified. Development threatens historic churches, theaters, schools and tenements, \"a unique architectural type which, by the sheer numbers who lived in such a building, had an impact on more Americans than any other form of urban housing,\" the National Trust said.\r\n\r\nMichigan Avenue Streetwall, Chicago, Illinois This 12-block stretch of historic buildings along Michigan Avenue between 11th and Randolph Streets dates back to the early 1880s. The streetwall is a collection of notable buildings by architects including Adler & Sullivan, Louis Sullivan, D. H. Burnham and Holabird & Roche, the National Trust said. Although the stretch was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002, the National Trust says its historic character is threatened by the inappropriate addition of large-scale towers that retain only small portions of the original buildings or their facades.\r\n\r\nPeace Bridge Neighborhood, Buffalo, New York The bridge and neighborhood, which has homes and buildings dating to the 1850s, includes two parks on the National Register of Historic Places that are part of Frederick Law Olmsted's park system. The Public Bridge Authority proposes to expand the bridge and build a 45-acre plaza that would destroy more than 100 homes and businesses, many of which are eligible for inclusion on the National Register, the National Trust said. According to the organization, the PBA has refused to \"properly consider\" other sites.\r\n\r\nThe Statler Hilton Hotel, Dallas, Texas When the Statler Hilton opened in downtown Dallas in 1956, it was considered the most modern hotel in the country.

But there are still large problem facing the country, including the world's second high level of HIV infections, according to the World Bank, and a slowing of the countries economic growth.\r\n\r\nThe 56-year-old Khama took over office in April 2008, succeeding Festus Mogae who had been in power for 10 years, promising no radical departure from his predecessor's policies.\r\n\r\nKhama was born in southern England and trained at the UK's Sandhurst Military Academy before returning to Botswana and later becoming the commander of the Botswana Defence Force.\r\n\r\nHe left the military in 1998 to take up the position of vice president. As the son of Botswana's most popular former president, political analysts inside the country have expected Khama to unite the factions in the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) and continue steady economic and political progress.\r\n\r\nWhile Khama has only been in power for 11 months, there has been some criticism that his style is too authoritarian.\r\n\r\nCiting Afrobarometer, an independent research group, Botswana's newspaper Sunday Standard recently wrote that there was a growing public perception that Khama has issued more directives compared to his predecessors.\r\n\r\nOne area in which he has taken a definite line is on his policy towards neighboring Zimbabwe", "2713": "high-school", "2714": "FIFA", "2715": "LONDON", "2716": "Joan Baez", "2717": "compiled a gallery of ten of the world's ugliest buildings", "2718": "he never gave up hope that she'd be found", "2719": "10", "2720": "$200 million", "2721": "the nervous system", "2722": "If convicted, they could both face the death penalty", "2723": "Economic issues", "2724": "a piece of debris forced the space station's current crew -- astronauts Mike Fincke and Sandy Magnus, and cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov -- to take shelter in its escape capsule", "2725": "Maseth's family", "2726": "The Lord's Resistance Army", "2727": "the landing was not a miracle, but rather the result of decades of practice and training.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn Wednesday, Sullenberger, 59, announced his retirement.

How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nKathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence.\r\n\r\n\"A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,\" she says. \"They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,\" says Klotz. \"Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together.\"\r\n\r\nBailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the \"Sit. Stay. Read.\" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,\" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. \"It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's \"Tail Waggin' Tutors\" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her.\r\n\r\n\"She really does sit there and stare at them,\" says Saroyan. \"And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.\"   See Minnie in action\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading.\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs.\r\n\r\n\"A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,\" she explains. \"They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year.

Increased time at home, however, resulted in improved morale among troops sent back to the field.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe updated survey of soldiers in Afghanistan found post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in soldiers at the same levels of the survey in 2007, but still about double that of the 2005 survey results: 21.4 percent in 2009, 23.4 percent for 2007 and 10.4 percent in 2005, according to the report.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Iraq, where the survey has been done every year, lower numbers were attributed to the decrease in combat action there. The 2009 numbers showed 13.3 percent of soldiers suffering from mental health problems, compared to 18.8 percent in 2007 and 22 percent in 2006.\r\r\n\r\r\nArmy officials said that with the push of more than 20,000 additional troops into the Afghan theater of battle over the last few months, there have been fewer mental health professionals in the field to help. Army officials said the ration was about one mental health professional for every 1,120 soldiers.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo combat the falling morale and lack of mental health professionals in the field, Army officials said the service needs to more than double the number of mental health providers and hopes to have at least 65 more of those providers in the field by December, making the ratio one for every 700 soldiers.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe mental health assessment teams also conducted interviews with soldiers and found a drop in unit morale in Afghanistan to about half of what it was in 2007 and 2005, when about 10 percent surveyed gave top ratings to unit morale. In 2009, that number was 5.7 percent.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe report also showed soldiers are seeing more difficulty at home with an increasing number reporting they are getting or considering getting divorced, according to the report.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe overall report was based on almost 4,000 soldiers who filled out anonymous surveys in Iraq and Afghanistan between December 2008 and June 2009.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Iraq, 2,400 soldiers were randomly selected and the results were studied by a mental health assessment team in the combat zone.

If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nSigning up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008.\r\r\n\r\r\nYou might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom?\r\r\n\r\r\nAnswer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).\r\r\n\r\r\nAmericans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels -- and staggering government deficits. The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts.\r\r\n\r\r\nZapatero slunk out of town a little while ago.

It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost.\r\n\r\nWithout clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified.\r\n\r\nIt's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in? Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real-life battle against cancer.\r\n\r\nFans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah (Lena Headey) in the new reality. Did she follow her son into the future? If not, what happened to her?\r\n\r\nFriedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now. He packs episodes with twists you don't see coming but make sense in retrospect. He changes up his style, drops lead characters for entire episodes, uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that's simultaneously believable and eloquent. He lets major characters die. And the show's directors coax subtle, nuanced performances from the actors.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't guess any of this from Fox's promotions, which have focused too heavily on Cameron (Summer Glau), the robot who helps protect John Connor (Thomas Dekker), sending the signal that it's a show just for teenage fanboys. Cameron and John's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize: the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life. It's in some ways the reverse of \"Buffy.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Fox may have done better promoting \"Chronicles\" as a family drama and then pairing it with one, rather than \"Dollhouse,\" the latest from \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon. (Insider question for fans: Is Josh Friedman the new Joss Whedon? Weigh in here or here.)\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear how, or if, the new movie \"Terminator: Salvation\" affects the show's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines, there's apparently no overlap and no conflict.\r\n\r\nThe weekly adventures of Sarah and John Connor just aren't done. There's too much unanswered, too much left to explore. So here's my pitch to network heads: You can still change the future. Don't terminate these \"Chronicles\" before their time.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts", "3422": "Broughton, north of London", "3423": "The tomb", "3424": "denied reports that armed groups were trying to re-establish a foothold in the area", "3425": "It was the first airdrop of humanitarian supplies by the U.S. military into Haiti since the deadly earthquake there nearly a week ago.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"There are so many relief agencies funneling through the airport that it has kind of created a bottleneck,\" U.S. Air Force Lt.

It explores the important, and too-little examined reality that judicial deliberations can be affected by a judge's background, perspective and experience.\r\n\r\nIn the next sentence immediately following the passage above, Judge Sotomayor says, \"Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice [Benjamin] Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society.\"\r\n\r\nCould she have been referring to Buck v. Bell, the 1927 case in which Justice Holmes -- widely regarded as perhaps the most brilliant justice in the Supreme Court's history -- upheld the state's plan to sterilize Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old white woman, who was accused of being congenitally retarded. Buck's main crime seems to have been the fact that she'd had a child out of wedlock.\r\n\r\nIn any case, Justice Holmes upheld the sterilization order, emphatically and coldly stating, \"three generations of imbeciles is enough.\" Does anyone seriously believe that a woman, and especially a woman of color \"with the richness of her experiences\" would not have \"reach[ed] a better conclusion \" than that adopted by Justice Holmes in 1927?\r\n\r\nIn fact Buck v.

I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi.\r\n\r\nI trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nThe marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.\r\n\r\nBy mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.\r\n\r\nThings began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.\r\n\r\nThe rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way.\r\n\r\nFinally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel.

Shooting broke out, and the gunplay continued for 45 minutes along several neighboring streets as the suspects tried to get away.\r\n\r\nThe armed men abandoned their cars, blocked one of the streets with a Suburban truck and fled aboard several other vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe confrontation continued for another two hours as soldiers sealed off a city block and searched house-to-house.\r\n\r\n\"From early on, we could hear the shots and much shouting,\" Excelsior and El Nuevo Leon quoted an unidentified woman as saying. \"We could hear footsteps on the roofs and soldiers yelling to them. There were several explosions; it seems like grenades went off, because we could hear it very loudly twice.\"\r\n\r\nAround 7:45 a.m., the soldiers entered a house where the gunmen had holed up. A grenade went off upstairs. Three gunmen died there, though officials did not say if it was from bullet wounds or the grenade explosion.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Mexican military and federal police were involved in a shootout with armed men in Escobedo. That confrontation left three soldiers wounded, with one of them clinging to life Monday afternoon.\r\n\r\nAlso nearby, a man and a woman riding in car were ambushed at an intersection by armed men in several cars who surrounded them and drilled their auto with bullets.\r\n\r\nThe woman died on the scene, her body sprawled on the street.

The idea, he explains, is to put civilians like us in a situation that mirrors a real mission.\r\n\r\nBut I've got a bigger mission ahead this weekend: Can I make a visit to the nation's capital, museums and historic sites at every turn, fun? I've brought along two sixth-graders from Stamford, Connecticut -- my cousin's son, Max Weinberg, and his friend, Miles Singer -- to see if I'm up to the challenge.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. The kids loved Operation Spy and the spy tools in the museum's permanent exhibits -- a Soviet listening device hidden inside the heel of a target's shoe, a lipstick pistol and poison gas gun nearly as much as they loved the gift shop, which offered every spy toy imaginable.\r\n\r\nNew lasers in hand, we adjourn next door to the upscale Zola restaurant (www.zoladc.com), which has a sophisticated ambience and menu to please the grown-ups, as well as a welcoming attitude toward kids ... not to mention terrific fries. (Memo to parents: If you take kids to a restaurant like this and they've outgrown the kids' menu, suggest they share a meal -- assuming they want the same thing.)\r\n\r\nOver dinner, the boys confess that learning about intelligence gathering was a lot more fun than learning how Congress works, and taking the Amtrak train (www.amtrak.com) was a lot more fun than driving or flying, because they could stay \"plugged in\" the entire trip, playing video games, watching movies and buying pizza and hot dogs. (Kids ride Amtrak for half price.)\r\n\r\nThe Palomar Hotel, a Kimpton Hotel, (www.hotelpalomar-dc.com), just a short walk from DuPont Circle and Rock Creek Park) proved an ideal choice for my \"mission\" too. The theme of this hotel is \"art in motion\" and when we get to our room, the kids find personalized cartoons drawn by a local cartoonist and an iHome to plug in their iPods. \"This makes me feel like a king,\" Miles declares, jumping on the bed. That's exactly what General Manager Brett Orlando, himself the father of young twins, wants to hear. \"Our job is to create an experience for kids as well as parents,\" he explains.\r\n\r\nThere is a treasure chest of toys for younger kids to borrow, a lending library of DVD movies and welcome swag that includes a card for free cookies from room service.\r\n\r\n(Check the hotel Website for the Link in Luxury package that allows you to book one room at a going rate -- weekend rates start at $229 and a second adjoining room for the kids for $50.

Visit www.washington.org).\r\n\r\nThe boys, of course, would have preferred to never leave the hotel but I promise we can skip all the \"boring stuff\"\" -- like the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, all art museums and even the White House.\r\n\r\nBut even without these stops, we had plenty to fill up our weekend.

[D]ropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American.\"\r\n\r\nThe president's commitment to education is truly remarkable, considering the enormous array of policy challenges confronting the administration. From health care and the economic crisis, to global warming and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration is beset by controversies that will not be easily resolved.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the president and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, have not allowed education to be ignored or placed on the back burner says a great deal about their recognition of its central importance to our nation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the administration navigates its way into the policy debates that are swirling over the future of education, it would be wise for it to proceed with caution.\r\n\r\nThe administration has already staked out positions on a number of issues -- charter schools and merit pay for teachers being two of the big ones -- which run the risk of generating additional controversy in the polarized debates over how to reform education.\r\n\r\nIf these issues and the stimulus money being made available under the Race to the Top (RTT) program are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue. The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers.\r\n\r\nThe current policy debates over the direction of education are typically presented as battles between the reformers, led by school superintendents like Joel Klein of New York and Michelle Rhee of Washington, D.C., and the defenders of the status quo, most often presented as the powerful teacher unions and other elements of the education establishment.\r\n\r\nWhile anyone familiar with the current debates knows that the differences between the two sides are real and profound, a protracted battle over the direction of education reform is not a good thing either for the administration or for those who genuinely want to see improvement in public education.\r\n\r\nInstead of choosing sides, it would be wise for the administration to do all it can to find common ground between the opposing camps as it formulates new policy initiatives.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of requiring states to adopt some form of merit pay for teachers -- a measure to which both the teachers' unions, the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have already declared their opposition -- the administration could encourage states to adopt school-based formulas that reward increases in student achievement.\r\n\r\nThis is similar, though not identical, to the approach taken in New York City, one that encourages collaboration among teachers and recognizes the importance of evidence that children are learning.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, rather than touting charter schools as the solution to public education, the administration should treat the best charters as models of innovation that provide educators with the flexibility to implement new strategies. This is a subtle but important distinction that has been lacking in many of the administration's pronouncements about charter schools.\r\n\r\nUnlike the public schools, many charter schools find ways to avoid serving the most disadvantaged students, and their teachers often work a longer day and longer school year without a contract.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of the best charters are subsidized by private philanthropists and are able to spend considerably more per pupil than traditional public schools. These facts should not be used to negate the accomplishments of the excellent charter schools that have emerged in many large cities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is far more likely that struggling public schools in these same cities would be more open to learning from the charters' accomplishments if they were not cast as competitors.\r\n\r\nFinally, the president has championed the idea of \"promise neighborhoods\" as a way to increase the availability of social services to children in high poverty communities, using as a model the Harlem Childrens Zone.\r\n\r\nIf this initiative is to result in lasting benefits to children, it will need to be combined with creative approaches to reforming urban public schools that re-formulate how we think about standards and focus attention more intently on how to deliver quality instruction to children.\r\n\r\nWith dropout rates at over 50 percent in several of our nation's cities, the administration must realize that tinkering at the margins with No Child Left Behind will not deliver the change we need.\r\n\r\nThe president entered office promising to bring a new kind of politics to the nation, an approach that focused on finding common ground among diverse constituencies to solve the pressing problems of our time", "4014": "above 60 percent", "4015": "19.8", "4016": "Arrow Stage Lines bus when it crashed on state Highway 163, about five miles north of Mexican Hat, at 7:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET), said Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Cameron Roden.\n\nTroopers reported the road was wet but not icy, he said.\n\nThe bus was traveling south", "4017": "64 percent in a CNN poll of polls in January shortly after his inauguration.\r\n\r\n\"The number of Americans who think Obama has the right personal qualities to be president has gone up since the campaign last fall,\" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director.  \"That wasn't true for George W.

I am proud to be there to represent them today.\n\nAfter almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997.

Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.\n\nAfter 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.\n\nBlackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.\n\nAt the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.\n\nThe areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.\n\nAny incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.\n\nIn doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.\n\nBlackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.\n\nThe company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States.

It has not yet been sold outside of the U.S.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles software consultant Brett Schulte, who is not affiliated with the developers, demonstrated the software for CNN Friday evening.\r\n\r\nAn iPhone that had the new software appeared to work on the T-Mobile system just seconds after Schulte replaced the AT&T SIM card with a T-Mobile SIM card.\r\n\r\n\"It's completely software hacked,\" Schulte said. \"There's no case opening required. It's not required to do any kind of disassembly.\" It took Schulte about two minutes to unlock the iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe developers would not give CNN their last names, saying \"We don't want to be hounded.\"\r\n\r\nThe said they would start selling the software, which they haven't yet priced, as soon as their online payment and customer service systems are ready.

You're obligated to pay the bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"When people buy the iPhone it's clear from our materials it's designed to operate exclusively on AT&T,\" Siegel said.\r\n\r\nSchulte, however, said it is possible to buy an iPhone without being contractually obligated to AT&T.\r\n\r\nThe developers recently created a Web site -- iPhoneSIMfree.com -- but there is very little information on it and no direct way for anyone to purchase the software. Internet records showed they bought the domain name less than two weeks ago.\r\n\r\nTwo members of the group, who identified themselves only as \"John\" and \"Liu,\" told CNN in a phone interview that a core group of six people on three continents worked to unlock the iPhone as a hobby.\r\n\r\nThey said they are fans of Apple products who thought the iPhone should be made accessible to people who cannot use AT&T", "4423": "Voltage Coffee", "4424": "British", "4425": "Mark Wallinger", "4426": "President Bush", "4427": "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton", "4428": "lone mitten", "4429": "He knew every detail of the trial and story", "4430": "Carles Puyol", "4431": "321", "4432": "conflict", "4433": "$22 billion", "4434": "Have groups deliver their presentations to the class", "4435": "Bear Grylls", "4436": "240", "4437": "the most serious charges against him", "4438": "1", "4439": "Algeria and Tunisia", "4440": "me the chance to escape reality", "4441": "Darfur", "4442": "1,500", "4443": "Manchester United", "4444": "four years ago", "4445": "improved morale among troops sent back to the field.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe updated survey of soldiers in Afghanistan found post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in soldiers at the same levels of the survey in 2007, but still about double that of the 2005 survey results: 21.4 percent in 2009, 23.4 percent for 2007 and 10.4 percent in 2005, according to the report.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Iraq, where the survey has been done every year, lower numbers were attributed to the decrease in combat action there.

I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers.\r\n\r\nIn the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: \"Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats will add pensively to the words: \"Not Done\" from the \"SNL\" skit, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans would add assertively : \"Not ever!\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the \"Camelot II\"; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him.\r\n\r\nHis campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun.\r\n\r\nIt's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast.\r\n\r\nGiving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care.\r\n\r\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise. It was the promise that his $787 billion stimulus package would create 3.5 million new jobs.\r\n\r\nIf \"SNL\" had asked the question, the answer would be: Not Done!

General Assembly, in which he praised Obama but criticized some U.S. policies.   Watch Chavez speak at the U.N.

I dream. I was born in the poor countryside. I was raised in the countryside, planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother. My children, my two daughters are with me and I want a better world for my grandchildren, for your grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\"Now, they demonize me.

I am very Christian and Catholic. ... I'm very faithful. I believe in God, in Jesus Christ. I love Jesus Christ. I am a Christian. ... I cry when I see injustice, children dying of hunger.\"\r\n\r\nHis comments were all the more remarkable because Chavez and the Catholic Church have been at odds since he came to power in 1999. The church has been one of his major critics, with Pope Benedict XVI and other church leaders expressing concern over what they see as attempts by Chavez to limit the church's influence.

Tour an iReporter's Barbie dream house \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nShe says the doll can evoke powerful emotions and has seen visitors weep for a lost sibling or childhood friend. But Holder, 51, who gave up a nursing career to pursue her Barbie dream more than 20 years ago, said that while trips to the museum can be emotional, they're also full of laughter and stories.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"No one leaves without sharing a fond portion of their childhood with me,\" said Holder, who once snagged a record for selling a doll at auction for $27,600.\r\r\n\r\r\nBarbie, however, doesn't conjure up smiles for everyone.\r\r\n\r\r\nThough the 11.5-inch doll can't be single-handedly blamed for the eating disorders and body-image issues that plague young women, Ellyn Kaschak, a psychology professor at San Jose Sate University in California, said Barbie, especially given her prevalence, is part of the problem.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I don't think the concerns are overblown at all,\" said Kaschak, one of the founders in the 1970s of the feminist psychology field. \"Blow her up to normal [human] size, and she'd fall over,\" she said of Barbie's unattainable figure.\r\r\n\r\r\nStill standing, however, is Cindy Jackson, a 53-year-old woman inspired by Barbie to do much more than collect dolls and splurge on matching outfits.\r\r\n\r\r\nOver the course of more than two decades, Jackson has gone under the knife for 13 full-scale operations, including multiple procedures each time, and hundreds of less intrusive cosmetic tune-ups in order to achieve the \"all-American beauty\" look she said Barbie represents.\r\r\n\r\r\nShe grew up in rural Ohio, \"plain and unpopular,\" she said. \"Every real woman around me was a farmer's wife, a factory worker, a mother or a school teacher. ... For me, it was soul-destroying. There was no glamour whatsoever.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd then she met her first Barbie, a vintage doll sporting a bubble cut, \"a sidelong glance\" and dressed as Jackie Kennedy, she remembered.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It was powerful,\" Jackson said from her London, England, home. \"I'd never seen a real woman who looked like that, and I thought, 'That's what I want to look like.' \"\r\r\n\r\r\nConcern about Barbie's looks and her values, including materialism -- she has worn about 1 billion outfits, Mattel's Dougherty said -- has at times gained ire from more than feminists and psychologists. The recent release of Tattoo Barbie, for instance, has gotten under the skin of some parents.  Watch video about the controversy \u00bb\r\r\n\r\r\nBut such criticism misses the point of what Barbie is all about, according to diehard fans. iReport.com: Barbie's body is not the issue\r\r\n\r\r\n\"It's not about wanting to look like her. It's about imagining what could be,\" said Nancy Parsons, of western Pennsylvania, who is chairwoman of the Barbie 50th Anniversary Gala, this year's collectors convention planned for July. \"People who say it's a bad influence -- they don't know the imagination that goes into playing with dolls. ... My sister always pretended she was a nurse, and [now] she's a nurse.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAll told, Barbie has held down 108 careers, Mattel says. She's been a police officer, a doctor, a veterinarian, an astronaut and a presidential candidate.\r\r\n\r\r\nWomen, by the way, are not the only ones drawn to Barbie. Up to 20 percent of annual convention attendees, who fly in from all over the world, are men, this year's chairwoman, Parsons, said. In her own collector's club there are two of them: \"One's a hair dresser, and one's an auto mechanic,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nScott Warren, 45, of Orlando, Florida, will attend his seventh consecutive annual convention this summer.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe \"novice fashion fan,\" as he described himself, has been collecting Barbies for about 14 years and counts among his favorites his Versace Barbie, Ralph Lauren Barbie and Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg Barbie.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I know there's no way I can afford a designer's original, but I think it's cool that my Barbies can,\" he said.

Part of the difference is based on biology. Female hormones, thyroid disease and brain biochemistry have all been cited as possible reasons. Genetics also play a part, as family history has proven that mental illness repeats itself across multiple generations. Socio-cultural reasons also contribute to the difference.\r\n\r\nJones stresses that the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to diagnosing and treating mental illness is not an effective approach and that acknowledging the gender differential is key to adequately and appropriately treating women.\r\n\r\nThe new report also underscores the relative young age at which mental illness often sets in for both males and females.

However, in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe murky story began in June of this year, when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena, Italy.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren's chief designer Mike Coughlan.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan's wife, Trudy Coughlan, had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren's Woking headquarters. An employee of the copy shop, suspicious that confidential data was being copied, blew the whistle to Ferrari.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney, a friend and former colleague of Coughlan's (the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s). Stepney had been the team's chief mechanic, but in February took his new role as the team's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena, Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\nFerrari issued the following press statement:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal, concerning the theft of technical information. Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMcLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut now the FIA is in possession of new evidence.

He's been set on fire and shared a kitchen with a grizzly bear. \"Some pretty crazy stuff.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThis month Sullivan spent a day being dunked in the Florida intercoastal waterway. Sullivan went parasailing in a suit wrapped in a product called Mighty Thirsty, plunging into the water to demonstrate its absorbency. \"It was a strange moment, but only Billy could have got me there.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBecause of his street market background -- or perhaps in spite of it -- Sullivan admits that some think his sales approach is more sophisticated than Mays' boisterous, bellowing banter.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think we're both relentless.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMays died shortly after he and Sullivan wrapped the first season of Discovery Channel's reality based TV series PitchMen.\r\r\n\r\r\nAccording to a Hillsborough County, Florida, autopsy report issued in August, Mays died from a heart attack -- with cocaine listed as a contributing factor.\r\r\n\r\r\nChoosing to move forward after Mays' death, Sullivan and Discovery are producing a second season of PitchMen without casting a replacement for Mays. The refreshed program will focus more on inventors who pitch their products to be accepted for a Sullivan TV ad campaign.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I think Billy would have slapped me on the side of the head if I didn't continue with it,\" said Sullivan.\r\r\n\r\r\n'Life's a pitch and then you buy it'\r\r\n\r\r\nMays lives on in thousands of YouTube videos, where he's often heard saying, \"Life's a pitch and then you buy it.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nEveryone is always selling or buying something, whether they realize it or not, said Sullivan.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"When your child's applying for college -- it's no different from pitching.

And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops.\r\n\r\n\"The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,\" Fadillioglu explained. \"So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the artists here never worked on a mosque before.\r\n\r\n\"It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,\" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. \"If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better.\"\r\n\r\nFadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area.

But here, he has no identity. No one has heard of him.\r\n\r\nIn this new future, he'll be fighting alongside his father, his uncle and a girl who looks just like the robot he came into the future to save. None of them has any idea who he is.\r\n\r\nConfused? Don't be. It was a daring, surprising, brilliant cliffhanger for a show that's gained a loyal following, particularly among people like me who are in awe of it. It also opens the door to anyone who hasn't discovered this show yet, allowing for a fresh start.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it may be too late. For fans, the big question is whether the \"Chronicles\" will be back, or canceled for inadequate ratings. We find out in a couple of weeks when Fox announces its schedule. The speculation online doesn't look good.\r\n\r\nEnding on this Season 2 cliffhanger would be a shame.\r\n\r\nWhen Fox picked up this \"Terminator,\" it took on one of the most successful sci-fi franchises in modern entertainment history. It courted \"Terminator\" fans, as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep, high-quality TV storytelling. Ending on this \"what happens now\" cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise's history.\r\n\r\nBut of bigger concern, of course, is that \"The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last. And that's thanks to Josh Friedman, the inspired executive producer.\r\n\r\nFor him, \"Terminator\" isn't about special effects and metal monsters. It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost.\r\n\r\nWithout clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified.\r\n\r\nIt's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in? Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real-life battle against cancer.\r\n\r\nFans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah (Lena Headey) in the new reality. Did she follow her son into the future? If not, what happened to her?\r\n\r\nFriedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now. He packs episodes with twists you don't see coming but make sense in retrospect. He changes up his style, drops lead characters for entire episodes, uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that's simultaneously believable and eloquent. He lets major characters die. And the show's directors coax subtle, nuanced performances from the actors.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't guess any of this from Fox's promotions, which have focused too heavily on Cameron (Summer Glau), the robot who helps protect John Connor (Thomas Dekker), sending the signal that it's a show just for teenage fanboys", "4905": "far-reaching ethics rules", "4906": "Jazz Legend Herbie Hancock", "4907": "nine more suspected pirates off the coast of Somalia Thursday -- the second capture in two days -- after receiving a distress call from an Indian-flagged commercial ship.\n\nSuspected pirates are arrested in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nAccording to the Navy announcement, at 4 a.m. local time the Indian-flagged Premdivya sent a distress call to all ships in the area reporting that she had been fired upon by a small skiff, and suspected pirates were attempting to board it.\n\nA U.S. Navy helicopter crew was launched from the USS Vella Gulf and fired two warning shots at the small boat to get them to stop.

A fast-food diet and little to no exercise helped her pack on the pounds, and her weight ballooned to over 200 pounds.\r\n\r\n\"It was my first year out of college, and that number, along with being diagnosed as morbidly obese, was very frightening,\" remembers Wygal. \"I went to several doctors, trying to get them to prescribe a weight-loss pill.\"\r\n\r\nBut none of her doctors would give her the quick fix she was looking for. Instead, a physician handed her a 1,600-calorie-a-day diet and told her to start moving.\r\n\r\nAt first, Wygal was shocked and refused to begin a diet that she thought was too restrictive. Even though her weight was rapidly approaching 300 pounds, she believed she had a pretty good diet and an active lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAs her weight crept up, Wygal grew more frustrated, and eventually she decided it was time to gain control of her life.\r\n\r\nShe started by keeping track of her daily calorie intake in a food diary and soon realized that her eating was worse than she thought.  Watch more from Tracey Wygal on her weight loss success. \u00bb\r\n\r\n\"I was amazed by how many calories I was eating,\" Wygal said. \"The food diary showed me that I really needed to get my food intake under control and helped me maintain my diet realistically.\"\r\n\r\nShe also started exercising.\r\n\r\nAt first, Wygal says, she was too embarrassed to go to a gym, so she bought an elliptical machine and started working out 15 minutes a day in her apartment.\r\n\r\n\"It was all I could do at first. I didn't give up, though,\" she said. \"Gradually, my endurance improved. After losing about 30 pounds, I decided to join a small gym.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral months later, Wygal was ready to take the next step. She hired a trainer and began a short strength-training program.\r\n\r\nThat's when something clicked.\r\n\r\nInstead of feeling intimidated, Wygal started to love her workouts and the physical changes taking shape with her body. Ready to take the next step, she joined a larger gym, began researching different workouts and got into weight training.\r\n\r\nOver the next three years, she lost 120 pounds and dropped seven dress sizes.

We are not at the beginning,\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a Senate committee Monday afternoon. \"We've been at it a month almost, but we are not near the end as well.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBP has successfully inserted a siphon into the damaged riser pipe from the underwater well at the heart of the spill. The procedure has allowed the company to collect more than 1,000 barrels (42,000 gallons) of oil a day that would otherwise spill into the Gulf, said Doug Suttles, the company's chief operating officer. That, combined with the use of chemical dispersants to break up the spill, has reduced the amount of oil reaching the surface, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"This [is] probably the smallest amount of oil I've seen on the surface since the effort began,\" Suttles said.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe well had been spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day into the Gulf since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Eleven workers are presumed dead after the sinking, and the cause has not been determined.\r\r\n\r\r\nSome of the oil has washed ashore on the Louisiana coast, and tar balls related to the spill have turned up as far east as Dauphin Island, Alabama.\r\r\n\r\r\nSome estimates put the amount of oil gushing from the well far higher than the 5,000-barrel-per-day estimate made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a few days after the spill began. Samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface.\r\r\n\r\r\nSamantha Joye, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia, told CNN's \"American Morning\" that the size of the suspected plumes is hard to determine.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Nothing like it has really ever been seen in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico before,\" she said. \"It's not only a large feature, but it's a very complex feature. There's a lot of vertical structure to it.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBut federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed. Charlie Henry, a scientific adviser from NOAA, said descriptions of \"layers of oil\" beneath the Gulf were \"totally untrue.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They were able to detect what we think is hydrocarbons in the water column. It was stated as oil, but it wasn't like oil you could see,\" Henry told reporters Monday afternoon.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe researchers were looking into the effects of the undersea dispersants used to break up the oil near the mouth of the well, nearly a mile beneath the surface, NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a statement issued Monday. But Lubchenco said the agency does not consider dispersants -- which have their own hazards -- \"a silver bullet.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\"They are used to move us towards the lesser of two environmental outcomes. Until the flow of oil is stemmed, we must take every responsible action to reduce the impact of the oil,\" she said.\r\r\n\r\r\nSuttles said the next step in capping the well is a \"top kill\" procedure, in which a large amount of heavy \"mud\" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, he said.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"That is the method we think we will be deploying later this week or this weekend,\" Suttles said. Another option -- putting debris in the well to stop the flow -- may also be utilized, he said. And once the leak is sealed, \"We intend to fill up the bottom of this well with cement and it will never be produced.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nBP, as the well's owner, is responsible for stopping the underwater gusher and paying for the cleanup, and Napolitano said the company has paid more than $9.6 million so far without denying a claim.\r\r\n\r\r\nBP America CEO Lamar McKay", "4968": "Batman", "4969": "We are gravely disappointed with the verdict,\" it said. \"We believe that the allegations made against our youth protection efforts are not valid", "4970": "Tsvangirai", "4971": "build a tolerant and peaceful society", "4972": "Gaza", "4973": "GTA IV", "4974": "Toussie's father", "4975": "four", "4976": "another dolphin", "4977": "go from renewing vows to filing for divorce in a year", "4978": "where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs", "4979": "anyone who's spent time with a dog will understand", "4980": "there are some common threads, like language issues, repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others, specific behavioral patterns", "4981": "make the V1 missile safe", "4982": "\"We might have another spike in the number of cases once we have our first rain", "4983": "German", "4984": "homeless", "4985": "At 7:15 p.m. Sunday, the river at Fargo was at 39.75 feet, lower than its early Saturday peak of 40.82 feet and below the previous record of 40.10 feet set in 1897, according to the weather service.
